talk_Dorado
0x2773	0x98	Dorado		Next time monsters appear, 
				I, Dorado, will take care	
				of them in a flash.	
0x27ee	0x98	Dorado		But I haven't seen any monsters	
				around anywhere lately, so that's	
				why I can speak so confidently, haha.	
0x2879	0x98	Dorado		I begged Orvus to start training	
				me this past year, too.	
0x28d2	0x98	Dorado		I wasn't useful at all during	
				the strange events a year ago,	
				so I want to become stronger.	
0x2953	0x98	Dorado		mp_0000 0x2773	
0x2a20	0x98	Dorado		It sure is peaceful...	
0x2a58	0x98	Dorado		It's hard to believe that those	
				abnormalities only happened a year ago.
0x2ae8	0x98	Dorado		*yawn*...	
				Even so, it's peaceful now.	
0x2b2e	0x98	Dorado		We removed the fallen rubble,	
				and that broken building	
				is completely cleaned up now...	
0x2b9d	0x98	Dorado		mp_0000 0x2a58	
0x2c5d	0x98	Dorado		Wha... It's C-COLD!	
0x2c91	0x98	Dorado		This doesn't look like rain...	
				What the hell is this stuff!?	
0x2d25	0x98	Dorado		I can't believe a girl so	
				beautiful would come to	
				Remnant Island for stay over...	
0x2d97	0x98	Dorado		And she's a friend of	
				yours, Nayuta? Why did 	
				you keep her from me?	
0x2e20	0x98	ALTO		Are you talking about Kureha?	
				Umm... I wasn't really keeping	
				her a secret or anything.	
0x2e8e	0x98	Dorado		Tch. Even so...	
				It sucks I'm not	
				your age anymore.	
0x2ee8	0x98	Dorado		If she was a year or two older,	
				she'd be in the strike zone...	
0x2f52	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2f84	0x98	ALTO		(Dorado is only 20, but	
				 he's already sounding	
				 like a dirty old man...)	
0x3024	0x98	Dorado		If she was a year or two older,	
				she'd be in the strike zone...
0x3091	0x98	Dorado		Nah, for now, maybe if I make	
				a good impression on her,	
				then later...later...	
0x30fd	0x98	ALTO		(Is he serious...?)	
0x3158	0x98	Dorado		For now, I have to make	
				a good impression on Kureha.	
0x31af	0x98	Dorado		Then she'll be in the strike	
				zone in a couple years...	
				Oh, I see a bright future ahead.	
0x3234	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x32b4	0x98	Dorado		Crap, while I was captivated,	
				I lost sight of her!	
0x3307	0x98	Dorado		I've got to find her somehow...	
				I at least have to ask for her name!	
0x339b	0x98	Dorado		Surely she's the daughter of some	
				noble who's come to the island.	
0x3401	0x98	Dorado		...Aah, it's useless.	
				Just thinking about that girl	
				makes my heart race!	
0x34a7	0x98	Dorado		N-Nayuta!?	
				...I-I-It's an emergency!!	
0x34f0	0x98	ALTO		What's wrong, Dorado?	
				Are there monsters on	
				the island again?	
0x3547	0x98	Dorado		J-Just now...	
				An unbelievably pretty	
				girl walked by...	
0x35a2	0x98	Dorado		I only caught a glimpse,	
				but that grace... Maybe I 	
				was just daydreaming!?	
0x360f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3641	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah...	
				(I knew it, it's	
				 about Kureha...)	
0x36b6	0x98	Dorado		Like a pure angel...	
				No, a goddess...!	
				And that peerless beauty...	
0x3717	0x98	Dorado		It seems like that Ada somehow	
				pulled her into her shop...	
				Why...?	
0x37ae	0x98	Dorado		E-Eartha collapsed!?	
0x37e9	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	
				I-I'll go visit her soon!!	
0x383b	0x98	Lupus		It's a good thing that Doctor	
				Hydol is here at the island.	
0x3892	0x98	Lupus		Well, anyone would think that right now,	
				especially if you're my brother Dorado.
0x3919	0x98	Dorado		W-Wha...the beautiful Eartha...	
0x3961	0x98	Dorado		This can't happen. I have	
				to visit her immediately!!	
0x3a0e	0x98	Dorado		Ada from the weapon shop	
				is not my type...	
0x3a63	0x98	Dorado		She's cute, but when she starts talking	
				about stuff like weapons, she becomes	
				so engrossed and can't stop,		
0x3af4	0x98	Dorado		...Whenever I take my spear in for repairs, she's	
				always all, "Your technique is unacceptable!"	
				and I get lectured at for half an hour.	
0x3b80	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3bda	0x98	Dorado		If someone came between Ada and her weapons,	
				even a superior officer would get no mercy.	
0x3c53	0x98	Dorado		I prefer the more the gentle and	
				graceful type, like Sasha or Eartha...	
0x3cb2	0x98	Dorado		Huh, Cygna? I just	
				saw him a minute ago.	
0x3cfb	0x98	Dorado		Looked like he was in a hurry.	
				He didn't respond when I called	
				out to him.	
0x3d4e	0x98	Dorado		I wonder what happened...	
0x3dbf	0x98	Dorado		Isn't Sasha from the	
				general store lovely?	
0x3e17	0x98	Dorado		She's still so young, yet she	
				manages the store by herself.	
				How industrious!	
0x3e81	0x98	Dorado		From the air about her,	
				I think she's the daughter	
				of a wealthy family somewhere...	
0x3f01	0x98	Dorado		With her true identity kept secret,	
				the sense of mystery is attractive, too.	
0x3f89	0x98	Dorado		I think Sasha from the general	store is	
				the daughter of a wealthy family somewhere...	
				She always dodges the question when I ask.	
0x4026	0x98	Dorado		With her true identity kept secret,	
				the sense of mystery is attractive, too.	
0x40c1	0x98	Dorado		Mm-hmm, seems Like it's good	
				to not get any closer for now.	
0x4126	0x98	Dorado		...All right, I'll	
				take up guard here!	
				None shall pass!	
0x4187	0x98	Dorado		So I'll let you handle the	
				monster extermination, Nayuta.	
0x41e8	0x98	ALTO		Now that you mention it, I've never	
				seen you fight, Dorado...	
0x4243	0x98	Dorado		H-Hey now, don't damage my reputation.	
0x428b	0x98	Dorado		E-Even I...!	
0x42d9	0x98	Dorado		I...I can do it if I have to, right?	
0x4320	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x437a	0x98	Dorado		There's monsters in that	
				fallen ruin for sure...	
0x43cb	0x98	Dorado		I have to protect everyone here, right?	
0x4413	0x98	Dorado		I can't leave my post here.	
				I'll let you guys handle	
				the monster extermination!	
0x44d6	0x98	Dorado		You seeーit's not like I forgot my lunch	
				because I wanted to eat one made by
				Eartha or anything, no...	
0x4550	0x98	Dorado		Really, it's not true!!	
0x459e	0x98	Dorado		mp_0000 0x44d6
0x4618	0x98	Dorado		mp_0000 0x4550
0x465c	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah, of course.	
				(He just blurted out his true	
				 feelings all by himself...)	
0x4702	0x98	Dorado		Hey, Nayuta! Have you	
				finished greeting Eartha?	
0x474f	0x98	ALTO		Oh, Dorado. Yeah, I just finished	
				putting away my luggage.	
0x47a3	0x98	ALTO		Haha, anyway, it's been so long	
				since I've seen you. How are you	
				doing with your guard duties?	
0x4824	0x98	Dorado		Well, same as always.	
0x485b	0x98	Dorado		This village is the embodiment of	
				peace itself, so there's almost	
				nothing to do, really.	
0x48cb	0x98	ALTO		Ha....I see.	
				Eartha is her usual	
				self too, I'm sure?	
0x4937	0x6B	Dorado		Ellipsis	
0x496b	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x499d	0x98	Dorado		Ooh... I'm so jealous of you.
				You have such a lovely sister.	
0x4a04	0x98	Dorado		What's more, not only is she beautiful,	
				but she's also kind and a great cook.	
0x4a6e	0x98	Dorado		...Nayuta. Would you like to	
				get a new older brother?	
0x4ab9	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4aeb	0x98	ALTO		(His womanizing hasn't changed...	
				 Perhaps that's the true sign of peace.)	
0x4b74	0x98	Dorado		I'm so jealous of you, Nayuta.	
				You have such a lovely sister.	
0x4bcf	0x98	Dorado		Ooh, I don't stand a chance.	
				She's out of my league.	
talk_Lupus
0x4cb7	0x98	Lupus		With a sudden flash of light, the fairy	
				Noi fell down onto the Tower Ruins.	
0x4d23	0x98	Lupus		But you went and lost	
				your memories, huh?	
0x4d66	0x98	Lupus		Oh, don't let it bother you too much.	
				Either way, if we can't have any kind	
				of excitement, life isn't worth living.	
0x4de3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4e0d	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x4e3e	0x98	NOI		Even though he seems worried,	
				he looks looks like he's	
				enjoying himself...	
0x4e8f	0x98	ALTO		Ha, Lupus is always like that.	
				You can just let him be.	
0x4f2a	0x98	Lupus		Either way, if we can't have any kind	
				of excitement, life isn't worth living.		
0x4f95	0x98	Lupus		Even though I'm still not entirely sure	
				what's going on, I can tell you've again	
				triggered interesting events to unfold.	
0x5034	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, Noi. I can tell you've again	
				triggered interesting events to unfold.	
0x50c9	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta. It looks like you've	
				been working pretty hard recently.	
0x5127	0x98	Lupus		What interesting things have you	
				dug up for me this time?	
0x517f	0x98	ALTO		(H-Hmm...that's a little vague.)	
0x51e8	0x98	Lupus		Nothing interesting has	
				happened lately.	
0x5230	0x98	Lupus		...Now that Cygna, Kureha and	
				Noi are gone, it feels like	
				something's missing...	
0x52af	0x98	Lupus		So this is snow...	
				I've heard rumors...	
0x5302	0x98	Lupus		Something like a strange phenomenon	
				where cold, white powder falls	
				from the sky...	
0x53ae	0x98	Lupus		Oh, I was wondering about Kureha...	
				I watch all the people coming to and	
				from the island every day, you see...	
0x542b	0x98	Lupus		When exactly did she come	
				to Nayuta's house?	
0x5477	0x98	ALTO		*gulp*...	
0x54a0	0x98	Lupus		Heh, well it's okay.	
				She's cute, even though	
				she's shrouded in mystery.	
0x552d	0x98	Lupus		But somehow, I've been getting the	
				feeling that mysterious things have	
				been happening around you lately.	
0x55a8	0x98	Lupus		It's just a coincidence, right?	
0x561c	0x98	Lupus		Hey, Nayuta, did you hear?	
				A super-beautiful girl came	
				to the island recently...	
0x568b	0x98	Lupus		According to my investigation,	
				eyewitnesses include Dorado,	
				Sculp, and Ada.	
0x56f2	0x98	Lupus		...Their reports corraborate the idea...	
				Perhaps I should investigate myself...	
0x5758	0x98	ALTO		(H-Hmm, with the way he is,	
				 it's only a matter of time before	
				 rumors spread...)	
0x57e6	0x98	Lupus		Hmmm, seems like she's	
				pretty close with Sculp.	
0x5833	0x98	Lupus		I have to investigate	
				further for now...	
0x58b2	0x98	Lupus		Say, Nayuta...where did you	
				obtain the medicinal herb	
				to cure Eartha's illness?	
0x5923	0x98	Lupus		Is the fact I haven't seen Cygna around	
				lately connected in any way?	
0x5980	0x98	ALTO		Well, you see...	
0x59b0	0x98	Lupus		Haha, well that's fine.	
0x59e8	0x98	Lupus		Even though there's lots of things about	
				this case that pique my interest, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine in the end.	
0x5a73	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you're ready to	
				talk about it, please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5ae5	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah...It's a promise.	
0x5b5f	0x98	Lupus		The medicinal herb used to cure	
				Eartha's illness, and the reason	
				Cygna's not around...	
0x5bd4	0x98	Lupus		Though there's various things that pique	mp_0000 0x59e8
				my interest, in the end, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine.	
0x5c5f	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you can talk about it,	mp_0000 0x5a73
				please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5cf9	0x98	Lupus		Though there's various things that pique	mp_0000 0x59e8
				my interest, in the end, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine.	
0x5d84	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you can talk about it,	mp_0000 0x5a73
				please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5e2e	0x98	Dorado		Wha, Eartha collapsed～!?	mp_0000 0x37ae
0x5e69	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	mp_0000 0x37e9
				I-I'll go visit her soon!!	
0x5ebb	0x98	Lupus		It's good that Doctor Hydol	mp_0000 0x383b
				just arrived at the island.	
0x5f12	0x98	Lupus		Well, if it's Dorado's older brother,	mp_0000 0x3892
				you'd have to think that.	
0x5f99	0x98	Lupus		I'll go see how she's doing later.	
0x5fdc	0x98	Lupus		...Sorry, I've got to bring the news	
				to the elder before that.	
0x6065	0x98	Lupus		There are some in this world who	
				claim that the world is spherical.		
0x60ce	0x98	Lupus		Of course, there are those	
				that think otherwise as well.	
0x6123	0x98	Lupus		If the ground was round,	
				people on the lower half would	
				fall off.	
0x6188	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, you know...	
				You might be surprised to learn	
				I also think the world is round.	
0x61f6	0x98	ALTO		If you look at the horizon out at	
				sea, there's a slight curve...	
0x623a	0x98	ALTO		The fact is, this is true no	
				matter where you go in the world.	
				No other theory can explain it...	
0x62c0	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x62f3	0x98	Lupus		...Ah, I see, I see.	
				Jeez, even you say things I	
				don't understand sometimes.	
0x6364	0x98	Lupus		Hehe... Well, you're	
				kind of a weirdo yourself,	
				Nayuta.	
0x63c2	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x63f4	0x98	ALTO		(Soundly rejected...)	
0x646b	0x98	Lupus		The curvature of the sea is
				just an optical illusion...	
				That's just common sense.	
0x64f0	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, even you say things	
				I don't understand sometimes.	
0x6549	0x98	Lupus		Hehe... Well, you're	
				kind of a weirdo yourself.	
0x65c9	0x98	Lupus		So the world is round because	
				the horizon is curved, eh?	
0x6623	0x98	Lupus		Hehe...As expected, you're	mp_0000 0x6364
				on a pretty strange heading,	
				Nayuta.	
0x66b9	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, did you guys just now...	
				carry a little doll-like	
				thing into your house?	
0x6729	0x98	Lupus		Did you find it in the ruins?	
0x6767	0x98	ALTO		Umm...	
				(A doll... He must be	
				 talking about Noi.)	
0x67b9	0x98	ALTO		(We wrapped her in cloth as we	
				 brought her home just in case,	
				 but someone still saw...)	
0x684a	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x687c	0x98	ALTO		(B-But...	
				 How do I	
				 explain this?)	
0x68cb	0x98	Lupus		(...Hmm, if he can't explain it,	
				 then they really did find something...)	
0x6935	0x98	Lupus		...Hehe, well, it's fine.	
				Show it to me eventually.	
0x6989	0x98	ALTO		U-Uh, yeah.	
0x69dc	0x98	Lupus		So there WAS a doll you	
				guys secretly carried	
				home from the ruins...	
0x6a3e	0x98	Lupus		...Hehe, feels like something	
				fun is about to happen.	
0x6acf	0x98	Lupus		My grandpa's stories,	
				and my brother Dorado's fear...	
				Those are entertaining enough. 	
0x6b27	0x98	Lupus		But the stuff that happened only
				just after you guys return...	
0x6b85	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, let's just say you've lived up to	
				your reputations as troublemakers.	
0x6bec	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6c1e	0x98	ALTO		(Such outrageous accusations...)	
0x6c87	0x98	Lupus		But it's still a shame. If it was	
				tourist season right now, it would	
				be even more exciting...	
0x6cf2	0x98	Lupus		Tourism fees...hmmm...	
0x6d2d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6d95	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta.	
				You look well.	
0x6dcf	0x98	ALTO		You too, Lupus.	
0x6dfe	0x98	ALTO		...is what I would normally	
				say, but why are you smiling
				at me like that?	
0x6e60	0x98	Lupus		Oh, you want to know?	
0x6e96	0x98	Lupus		Whatever you say. It's because
				you troublemakers have returned
				to the village.	
0x6f0e	0x98	Lupus		It's about time something	
				interesting happened in this	
				peaceful, boring village.	
0x6f93	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6fc5	0x98	ALTO		Troublemakers?	
				Maybe, if we're talking	
				about Cygna, sure.	
0x7018	0x98	Lupus		No, no. Though you might act innocent,	
				you, too, have plenty of inclinations	
				of that nature too, don't you think?	
0x7097	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, that's why I'm excited	
				for summer vacation, anyway.	
0x712d	0x98	Lupus		This village is too peaceful,	
				and a kind of boring.	
0x717f	0x98	Lupus		But the troublemakers	
				Nayuta and Cygna	
				have returned...	
0x71d7	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, so that's why I'm excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for summer vacation.	
0x7253	0x98	Lupus		This village is too peaceful,	mp_0000 0x712d
				and a little boring.	
0x72a5	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, so that's why I'm excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for summer vacation.	
talk_Aquela
0x7370	0x98	Aquela		Oh my, you...	
0x73a0	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, you have kind eyes, don't you?	
0x73e6	0x98	Aquela		And so, in my reading of the stars,	
				I can see you are one burdened	
				with a great destiny.
0x744b	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x747f	0x98	ALTO		Um, and you are...?	
0x74ae	0x98	Aquela		Hehehe... As an astrologer, I	
				take great interest in you.	
0x7507	0x98	Aquela		That is how it seems to me, boy.	
				I want you to keep this.	
0x7558	0xC1	System		obtained.	
0x75d7	0x98	Aquela		I get some very interesting	
				premonitions from you...	
				This is thanks for that.	
0x7692	0x98	Aquela		...Though I didn't plan on
				visiting this island again.	
0x76e9	0x98	Aquela		This presence... It seems that	
				fate has again begun to turn.	
0x7745	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, relax, boy.	
				I don't intend to impede you.	
0x77bc	0x98	Aquela		It seems that the fate that was severed	
				from this island has again begun to turn.	
0x7828	0x98	Aquela		My astrology did not foresee this.	
				It's possible some great power	
				is at work.	
talk_Sculp
0x7935	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta, I've got	
				something I want you to hear.	
0x7988	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	
				What is it?	
0x79cb	0x98	Sculp		I actually heard this	
				from Antlia recently...	
0x7a23	0x98	Sculp		Apparently using fertile soil	
				will greatly improve crop yield.	
0x7a7d	0x98	Sculp		It's better than manure, and	
				pretty popular on the continent.	
0x7adf	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	
				I can't find any good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x7b57	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh?	
				I don't think I have any	
				good ideas.	
0x7bb0	0x98	ALTO		To start with, Remnant Island soil	
				is probably rocky and full of salt...	
0x7c18	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	
				It's probably as you say.	
0x7c75	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems like its		
				nothing but a fantasy for us	
				here, eh? Sorry, my bad.	
0x7cd2	0x98	Sculp		But if you find some good soil	
				somewhere, it'd be helpful	
				if you could give me some.	
0x7d44	0x98	Sculp		Will you keep that in mind for me?	
0x7d86	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	
0x7db3	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile soil, huh?	
				 If I find some, I should try	
				 bringing it to Sculp.)	
0x7f0a	0x98	Sculp		Bootie has gotten all fired up	
				about helping with the house	
				for some reason.	
0x7f6a	0x98	Sculp		Maybe that kid who has been	
				nothing but trouble until now has	
				started to grow up a little.	
0x7fcf	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare	
				chance, I've got to teach	
				him well.	
0x8051	0x98	Sculp		Somehow, Bootie has gotten	mp_0000 0x7f0a	
				fired up about helping with	
				the house.	
0x80b1	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare	mp_0000 0x7fcf
				chance, I've got to teach	
				him well.	
0x8141	0x98	Sculp		Oh, if it isn't Nayuta!	
				Thanks for helping me with milking	
				Jessica all this time.	
0x81b1	0x98	Sculp		If only Bootie would let me	
				teach him about work...	
0x8209	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, it can't be helped.	
				Bootie's at the time in his life when	
				he wants to do nothing but play.	
0x827e	0x98	ALTO		I'll help you out anytime you need,	
				so please ask me anytime.	
0x82e3	0x98	Sculp		Haha, I think I'll do that.	
0x8347	0x98	Sculp		I want to teach Bootie too, but	
				he's not the least bit interested.	
0x83a9	0x98	Sculp		Good grief, when it comes to	
				summertime, all I can do	
				is rely on you, Nayuta.	
0x8431	0x98	Sculp		I-It's cold! ...What's happening!?	
0x8470	0x98	Sculp		This isn't good.	
				I've got to check on the crops...	
0x84c0	0x98	Sculp		I can't let my babies raised with	
				my own blood, sweat and tears die!	
0x854f	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta. If you're looking	
				for Kureha, she just passed by	
				here a minute ago.	
0x85c3	0x98	Sculp		She said she was going	
				on an errand somewhere.	
0x8611	0x98	ALTO		I see...	
				Thanks, Sculp!	
0x8674	0x98	Sculp		Are you looking for her?	
0x86ad	0x98	Sculp		In that case, you might	
				want to look over that way.	
				She hasn't come back yet.	
0x8751	0x98	Sculp		Today, that beautiful girl	
				helped me with the	
				harvesting work.	
0x87ae	0x98	Sculp		She said she was staying	
				at your place, but...	
				Is that really true?	
0x8814	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, lots of things	
				happened, and now	
				she's staying over.	
0x886c	0x98	Sculp		Oh, really?	
0x889f	0x98	Sculp		Man, I was surprised when she	
				came up to me saying she wants	
				to help, but...	
0x8907	0x98	Sculp		Thanks to her help, I was able	
				to finish work quickly today.	
				Yeah, she was a big help.	
0x899a	0x98	Sculp		Kureha...was it?	
0x89d9	0x98	Sculp		She's beautiful, graceful, and	
				above all, considerate.	
				Hmm, she's a good kid.	
0x8ab4	0x98	Sculp		Just now, Canie went	
				for a sick visit.	
0x8afa	0x98	Sculp		It will be difficult moving forward...	
				If you ever need any help,	
				you can always rely on us.	
0x8b97	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, everyone is searching	
				for a way to cure Eartha.	
0x8bee	0x98	Sculp		Though I don't have anything like a	
				vegetable that cures illness, we'll
				see if something like that exists.	
0x8c9c	0x98	Sculp		Eartha collapsed, right?	
0x8cda	0x98	Sculp		Canie said she was going	
				to see how she's doing, but...	
				Is she still not feeling well?	
0x8d46	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x8d78	0x98	Sculp		...Right...	
				Anyway, cheer up.	
0x8ddd	0x98	Sculp		Although Eartha collapsed...	
				You should try to cheer up.	
0x8e86	0x98	Sculp		We have a small field on the	
				back of the island, but lately,	
				the weather has been acting strange.	
0x8f06	0x98	Sculp		It's been strangely hot, with constant rain...	
				Thanks to that, the vegetables	
				aren't growing very well.	
0x8f83	0x98	Sculp		However, rumor has it that Remnant Island	
				isn't the only place where the weather	
				has been strange.	
0x8fef	0x98	Sculp		It's been strange this year on lots	
				of islands. Everyone is in trouble.	
0x9085	0x98	Sculp		It seems like it isn't only	
				on Remnant Island where the	
				weather has been strange.	
0x90dc	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, working the fields is difficult.	
				You're subject to the whim	
				of gods in heaven.	
0x9166	0x98	Sculp		Man, that scared me.	
				I've never seen one that big.	
0x91c6	0x98	Sculp		...Anyhow, I have to check the field	
				later to see if there's any damage.	
0x9260	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta!	
				As expected, you've grown in the	
				short time you were away.	
0x92cc	0x98	Sculp		For a minute there, I thought you	
				were a giant or something.	
0x931e	0x98	ALTO		Haha... You exaggerate too much, Sculp.	
0x9365	0x98	ALTO		It's only been four months	
				since I left.	
0x93ae	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, I exaggerated a bit.	
				You're steadily growing taller	
				during your growth spurt.	
0x944d	0x98	Sculp		Come now, say hi to	
				Jessica for me.	
0x94b4	0x98	Cow		Moooooooo～...	
0x94e1	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I'm back, Jessica.	
0x9551	0x98	Sculp		Well, you'll be here a while during your	
				summer break, right? You should take	
				it easy and relax while you're here.	
0x9606	0x98	Sculp		Since you'll be here a while,	
				you should take it easy.	
0x965b	0x98	Sculp		Since it's your summer vacation,	
				don't let anything worry you too much.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x974f	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	
				Isn't that pretty good soil!?	
0x97a3	0x98	Sculp		It's dark, has a soft feel and a fragrant,	
				earthy scent... There's no mistaking it─	
				It's of excellent quality.	
0x9830	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I actually found it somewhere...	
0x987a	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's all right,	
				can I give it to you?	
0x9907	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	
0x993c	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x99b7	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha from the general	
				store came by and said she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x9a31	0x98	Sculp		Since she wants to buy my vegetables,	
				I'm honored by the request.	
				I thought I would respond in turn.	
0x9aca	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, you helped me out, Nayuta.	
				Please use this well for me.	
0x9b29	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	
0x9b66	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	
				don't hesitate to ask.	
0x9bbe	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	
				Then, I look forward to it, Nayuta.	
0x9c4d	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	
				to the general store stock.	
0x9c9e	0x07	System	#4C	If you give soil to Sculp,	
				the lineup of vegetables the general

0x9d16	0x07	System	#4C	If you find soil,	
				be sure to bring it here.	
0x9dac	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	
				It looks like you have	
				some good soil again.	
0x9e06	0x98	Sculp		If it's okay with you, can you please	
				give it to me? I've got some things
				I want to try on the field again.	
0x9e8c	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	
				If it is useful to you, Sculp.	
0x9f04	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this is very fertile too.	
0x9f44	0x98	Sculp		All right...time to go try it.	
0x9f81	0x98	Sculp		The vegetables sell so quickly	
				I have able to grow more now.	
0xa012	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d
				to the general store lineup.	
0xa09d	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0xa0f7	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's ridiculously high	
				quality... Hmm, just where on	
				Remnant Island did you get his...?	
0xa17c	0x98	ALTO		Uh, there's various places.	
0xa1ba	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I'm giving	
				this to you, Sculp.	
0xa22e	0x98	Sculp		Thanks as always.	
				You're a great help.	
0xa277	0x98	Sculp		With soil this good,	
				I must be able produce	
				even more vegetables!	
0xa2ef	0x98	Sculp		Ha, for a farmer, there's	
				no better happiness than this.	
0xa355	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these new	
				vegetables to the general store.	
				Nayuta, I'm glad you found this for me.	
0xa416	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

0xa7f5	0x98	Bootie		...Nayuta, you still think	
				of me as a kid, don't you?	
0xa855	0x98	Bootie		Not anymore. I even help	
				around the house.	
0xa899	0x98	Bootie		...Sometimes, anyway.	
0xa8dc	0x98	ALTO		Haha, is that right?	
				You HAVE grown, Bootie.	
0xa927	0x98	Bootie		...I knew it, you're irritating.	
0xa994	0x98	Bootie		I'm already 11, so	
				I can look after Jessica	
				all by myself.	
0xa9f3	0x98	Bootie		I'll never again have to ask	
				the Handyman Shop for help.	
				Remember that, Nayuta!	
0xaa95	0x98	Bootie		Wow, it got cloudy all of	
				a sudden! Is this snow?	
				It's so COLD!!	
0xaae3	0x98	Bootie		...Achoo!!	
0xab0f	0x98	Bootie		Erm... Maybe I should stay home after all...	
0xab85	0x98	Bootie		Even though it's my first time	
				seeing snow, I finally understand...	
0xabe5	0x98	Bootie		Why they call it a cold	
				when you get sick...
0xac63	0x98	Bootie		Huh, you haven't seen Cygna?	
0xac9f	0x98	Bootie		...I just saw him earlier, see─.	
				He kind of had a serious look on his face.	
0xad09	0x98	ALTO		A serious look...?	
0xad3b	0x98	Bootie		Well, y'know, I'm not sure.	
				It just felt like it would be	
				hard to get him to play with me.	
0xadac	0x98	Bootie		I saw him going to the beach,	
				but I haven't seen him since then.	
0xae0d	0x98	ALTO		Got it... Thanks.	
0xae6c	0x98	Bootie		In the general store, there's	
				some star shard souvenirs	
				on display.	
0xaed2	0x98	Bootie		They're not like the small ones I	
				usually pick up, you can actually	
				see another world with them.	
0xaf4c	0x98	Bootie		...Man, those are nice.	
				I want one...	
0xafd6	0x98	Bootie		D-Damn... I want to go too...	
0xb014	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, no fair!	
				Take me with you!	
0xb057	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry, Bootie.	
				It's dangerous, after all.	
0xb0a6	0x98	Bootie		Damn it... So arrogant just because

0xb173	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, don't take too

				I'll gonna go see it, you hear!?	
talk_Pyxia
0xb25a	0x98	Pyxia		Hehe, I again come in	
				search for a painting subject.	
0xb2ad	0x98	Pyxia		In the art contest this year, I'm sure	
				to be the one to take first place.	
0xb30a	0x98	Pyxia		There's no match for me, now	
				that I've leveled up as an	
				artist from "egg" to "chick!"	
0xb3a7	0x98	Pyxia		mp_0000 0xb30a		
0xb41c	0x98	Pyxia		And this year for sure,	
				I will become a chicken!	
0xb46d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb4d5	0x98	Pyxia		Seems like the specialty product	
				they call "star shards" project	
				amazingly beautiful scenery.	
0xb54c	0x98	Pyxia		And there are people who	
				sketch that scenery...	
				...I can't lose to them!	
0xb5bf	0x98	Pyxia		If that's the case, I'll have to paint	
				the landscapes only I could make, using	
				the images inside my head!		
0xb641	0x98	Horolo		Pyxia, I think that's	
				called abstract art.	
0xb6cc	0x98	Pyxia		Something like sketching	
				star shard landscapes...	
				That's a pretty good idea.	
0xb744	0x98	Pyxia		Hehe, I can't lose...	
				Not to an egg-level artist.	
0xb792	0x98	ALTO		(Has an unseen rival	
				 to my sister appeared?)	
0xb81f	0x98	Pyxia		You! Thank you so much!	
0xb859	0x98	Pyxia		If I have these pigments, I should	
				be able to draw an amazing picture!	
0xb8d3	0x98	Pyxia	#18S	My goal is be a chicken-level artist!	
0xb941	0x98	Pyxia		This is Remnant Island...	
				Sure is a relaxed place.	
0xb999	0x98	Pyxia		Though it seems like lots of	
				interesting things happen here, too...	
0xb9f3	0x98	Pyxia		I feel like I can get some great	
				inspiration from this place!	
0xba7f	0x98	Pyxia		...Say, why is	
				everyone so down?	
0xbabf	0x98	Pyxia		Though, I'm not good with ink.	
talk_Horolo
0xbb48	0x98	Horolo		So, Pyxia, I made Remnant Island the	
				theme of my painting last year.	
0xbbaf	0x98	Horolo		With that, I won the special prize	
				in another art contest.	
0xbc13	0x98	Horolo		Hehe, I've never not won	
				the prize in a contest...	
0xbc6d	0x98	Horolo		I've got to do my	
				best again this year.	
0xbcb5	0x98	ALTO		(...Did she just casually admit	
				 something amazing just now?)	
0xbd3b	0x98	Horolo		Since Pyxia is doing her best,	
				I have to do my best too.	
0xbd96	0x98	Horolo		I hope I can find

0xc089	0x98	Horolo		I yearn to do it myself～,	
				as I am an "egg" of a sculptor.	
0xc112	0x98	Horolo		Hehe, Pyxia,	
				I would be glad to～.	
0xc155	0x98	Horolo		I've got to say

0xc194	0x98	Horolo		You've got to cheer up too～.	
0xc1f7	0x98	Horolo		This time, it'll be a

				before on the continent.	
0xc25e	0x98	Horolo		I'm here with my friend Pyxia	
				to search for a good motif...

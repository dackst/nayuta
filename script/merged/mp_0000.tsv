talk_Dorado
0x2773	0x98	Dorado		When monsters come out this	
				time, I, Dorado, will take care	
				of them in the blink of an eye.	
0x27ee	0x98	Dorado		Lately, I haven't seen monsters or	
				anything at all around, and	
				that's why I can say that, hahaha.	
0x2879	0x98	Dorado		I too, pleaded with Orvus to	
				receive training this year.	
0x28d2	0x98	Dorado		Because I wasn't useful during	
				the strange events a year ago,	
				somehow, I want to become stronger.	
0x2953	0x98	Dorado		When monsters come out this	mp_0000 0x2773
				time, I, Dorado, will take care	
				of them in the blink of an eye.	
0x2a20	0x98	Dorado		It sure is peaceful...	
0x2a58	0x98	Dorado		That strange events like the ones	
				last year could occur,	
				It's on the level where you can't believe it.	
0x2ae8	0x98	Dorado		*Yawn*...	
				Even so, there's peace now.	
0x2b2e	0x98	Dorado		We removed the rubble,	
				and that broken building	
				is completely cleaned up now...	
0x2b9d	0x98	Dorado		That strange events like the ones	mp_0000 0x2a58
				last year could occur,	
				It's on the level where you can't believe it.	
0x2c5d	0x98	Dorado		Wha...I-It's COLD!	
0x2c91	0x98	Dorado		It doesn't look like rain but...	
				What the hell is this anyway!?	
0x2d25	0x98	Dorado		I can't believe a girl that	
				beautiful would come to	
				Remnant Island for homestay...	
0x2d97	0x98	Dorado		And what's more, it seems she	
				is an acquaintance of yours, Nayuta.	
				Why did you keep her a secret from me?	
0x2e20	0x98	ALTO		You're talking about Kureha?	
				Hmm, I wasn't really keeping	
				secrets or anything...	
0x2e8e	0x98	Dorado		Tch. However...	
				I regret that I'm not the	
				same age as you.	
0x2ee8	0x98	Dorado		If she was one or two years older,	
				she would've been in the	
				strike zone...	
0x2f52	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2f84	0x98	ALTO		(Dorado is quite like an old man already...	
				 Even though he's only 20.)	
0x3024	0x98	Dorado		If Kureha was one or two years older,	
				she would've been in the	
				strike zone...	
0x3091	0x98	Dorado		Nah, for right now, if I make	
				a good impression on her,	
				then later, later...	
0x30fd	0x98	ALTO		(Is he serious...?)	
0x3158	0x98	Dorado		For now, I've got to make	
				a good impression on Kureha.	
0x31af	0x98	Dorado		Then, she'll be in the strike	
				zone in one or two years...	
				Ah, I've got to think about the rose color.	
0x3234	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x32b4	0x98	Dorado		Crap, while I was fascinated,	
				I lost sight of her!	
0x3307	0x98	Dorado		I've got to find her somehow...	
				At the very least, I've	
				got to ask her name!	
0x339b	0x98	Dorado		There's no mistake that she's some	
				young lady who came to the island.	
0x3401	0x98	Dorado		...Ah, it's useless.	
				Just by thinking about that girl,	
				I get heart palpitations!	
0x34a7	0x98	Dorado		N-Nayuta!?	
				...T-T-This is an emergency!!	
0x34f0	0x98	ALTO		What's wrong, Dorado?	
				Is it monsters on the island	
				again?	
0x3547	0x98	Dorado		J-Just now...	
				An unbelievably pretty	
				girl passed by here...	
0x35a2	0x98	Dorado		I only caught a glimpse,	
				but that grace...	
				Maybe I saw a dream or something!?	
0x360f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3641	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah...	
				(As I thought, it's	
				 about Kureha...)	
0x36b6	0x98	Dorado		Like a white angel...no, a goddess!?	
				And that peerless beauty...	
0x3717	0x98	Dorado		Somehow it seems that Ada	
				has pulled her into her shop...	
				Why??	
0x37ae	0x98	Dorado		Wha, Eartha collapsed～!?	
0x37e9	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	
				I-I'll go visit her soon!!	
0x383b	0x98	Lupus		It's good that Doctor Hydol	
				just arrived at the island.	
0x3892	0x98	Lupus		Well, if it's Dorado's older brother,	
				you'd have to think that.	
0x3919	0x98	Dorado		Wh-wh-wha...The beautiful Eartha is...	
0x3961	0x98	Dorado		Things can't be like this.	
				I've got to visit her immediately!!	
0x3a0e	0x98	Dorado		Ada from the weapon shop	
				is removed from my taste...	
0x3a63	0x98	Dorado		When the conversation turns to weapons	
				and stuff, she can't stop talking about them,	
				but she has cute points too.	
0x3af4	0x98	Dorado		...When I submit my spear for repair,	
				it's always, "Your technique is unacceptable!"	
				and I'm hit every time.	
0x3b80	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3bda	0x98	Dorado		When it comes to Ada talking about	
				weapons, even an older companion	
				wouldn't forgive her.	
0x3c53	0x98	Dorado		Mine is the graceful type,	
				like Sasha or Eartha...	
0x3cb2	0x98	Dorado		Eh, Cygna?	
				I saw him a little while ago.	
0x3cfb	0x98	Dorado		He was in a hurry, and	
				didn't want to talk at all.	
0x3d4e	0x98	Dorado		I wonder what happened...	
0x3dbf	0x98	Dorado		Don't you think Sasha	
				from the general store is lovely?	
0x3e17	0x98	Dorado		She is still young, but she	
				manages the store by herself.	
				How industrious!	
0x3e81	0x98	Dorado		From the atmosphere surrounding	
				her, I think she's the daughter	
				of a wealthy family somewhere...	
0x3f01	0x98	Dorado		When her true identity isn't revealed,	
				the mystery is good too.	
0x3f89	0x98	Dorado		I think Sasha from the general store is	
				the daughter of a rich family somewhere...	
				She always dodges the question when I ask.	
0x4026	0x98	Dorado		But, when her true identity isn't revealed,	
				the mystery is good too.	
0x40c1	0x98	Dorado		Hmmhmm, it seems it's good	
				to not get any closer for a little while.	
0x4126	0x98	Dorado		...Alright, I'll assume the guard!	
				I won't let anyone past here!	
0x4187	0x98	Dorado		That's why I'm leaving the	
				monster extermination to you, Nayuta.	
0x41e8	0x98	ALTO		Now that you mention it, I've never	
				seen you fight Dorado...	
0x4243	0x98	Dorado		H-Hey, hey,	
				don't damage my reputation.	
0x428b	0x98	Dorado		E-Even I...!	
0x42d9	0x98	Dorado		I...I'll do it when I have to, right?	
0x4320	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x437a	0x98	Dorado		There's monsters in that	
				fallen ruin for sure...	
0x43cb	0x98	Dorado		I've got to protect everyone	
				here, see?	
0x4413	0x98	Dorado		I can't move from this place.	
				I'll leave the monster extermination	
				to you guys!	
0x44d6	0x98	Dorado		Now you seeー	
				It's not the case that I forgot my lunch	
				because I wanted to eat Eartha's...	
0x4550	0x98	Dorado		Truly, that was not my intention!!	
0x459e	0x98	Dorado		Now you seeー	mp_0000 0x44d6
				It's not the case that I forgot my lunch	
				because I wanted to eat Eartha's...	
0x4618	0x98	Dorado		Truly, that was not my intention!!	mp_0000 0x4550
0x465c	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah, understood.	
				(He just himself declared	
				 his true feelings...)	
0x4702	0x98	Dorado		Hey, Nayuta! Did you finish	
				greeting Eartha?	
0x474f	0x98	ALTO		Oh, Dorado. Yeah, I just finished	
				stowing my luggage.	
0x47a3	0x98	ALTO		Haha, at any rate, it's been awhile since I've seen you.	
				How are you doing with your guard duties?	
0x4824	0x98	Dorado		Well, it's as always.	
0x485b	0x98	Dorado		Because this village is peace itself,	
				honestly speaking, there's almost no	
				work.	
0x48cb	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha....is that so.	
				My sis is her usual peaceful	
				self too, no doubt about it.	
0x4937	0x6B	Dorado		Ellipsis	
0x496b	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x499d	0x98	Dorado		Huh-?...	
				I'm jealous of you as expected.	
				You have such a lovely sister.	
0x4a04	0x98	Dorado		What's more, she's not merely beautiful.	
				She is kind, and a skilled cook.	
0x4a6e	0x98	Dorado		...Nayuta...	
				Do you want an older brother?	
0x4ab9	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4aeb	0x98	ALTO		(That he likes girls hasn't changed...	
				 It's true proof of peace.)	
0x4b74	0x98	Dorado		I'm jealous of you, Nayuta.	
				You have such a lovely sister.	
0x4bcf	0x98	Dorado		Ah, I don't have a chance.	
				We're not on the same level.	
talk_Lupus
0x4cb7	0x98	Lupus		With a sudden flash of light, the fairy	
				Noi fell down onto the ruined tower.	
0x4d23	0x98	Lupus		But, you lost those	
				memories...huh.	
0x4d66	0x98	Lupus		Oh, this and that.	
				Either way, if we don't have excitement	
				like this, life isn't worth living.	
0x4de3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4e0d	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x4e3e	0x98	NOI		Even though he's enjoying	
				himself, he's troubled...	
0x4e8f	0x98	ALTO		Haha, you're always like	
				this, Lupus.	
				I'll leave you alone.	
0x4f2a	0x98	Lupus		Either way, if we don't have excitement	
				like this, life isn't worth living.	
0x4f95	0x98	Lupus		Though I don't understand what's what,	
				again you caused various events to	
				happen for me.	
0x5034	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, Noi.	
				Again you caused various events to	
				happen for me.	
0x50c9	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta. Lately, it seems you've	
				been working hard somehow.	
0x5127	0x98	Lupus		What interesting thing have you	
				dug up for me this time?	
0x517f	0x98	ALTO		(H-Hmm...	
				 that's a little vague.)	
0x51e8	0x98	Lupus		Nothing interesting has happened	
				lately.	
0x5230	0x98	Lupus		...Because Cygna, Kureha and	
				Noi aren't here, something's	
				lacking...	
0x52af	0x98	Lupus		So this is "snow"...	
				I heard about it in a rumor...	
0x5302	0x98	Lupus		Something like cold, white powder	
				falling from the sky, it's like	
				a strange phenomenon...	
0x53ae	0x98	Lupus		Oh, Kureha...Ahem.	
				I check each person coming to and	
				leaving the village every day, you see...	
0x542b	0x98	Lupus		When exactly did she come	
				to Nayuta's house?	
0x5477	0x98	ALTO		(Gulp...)	
0x54a0	0x98	Lupus		Heh, well that's fine.	
				Though she's shrouded in mysteries,	
				she's cute.	
0x552d	0x98	Lupus		But somehow, I get the feeling that	
				mysterious things are occurring around you	
				often lately.	
0x55a8	0x98	Lupus		This is a coincidence, right?	
0x561c	0x98	Lupus		Hey, Nayuta, did you hear?	
				A super-beautiful girl came to	
				the island recently...	
0x568b	0x98	Lupus		According to my investigation, the	
				witnesses were Dorado, Sculp and	
				Ada.	
0x56f2	0x98	Lupus		...Somehow, it doesn't seem false...	
				I should investigate it myself...	
0x5758	0x98	ALTO		(H-Hmm, with this,	
				 it's just a matter of time before	
				 rumors spread...)	
0x57e6	0x98	Lupus		Hmmm, it seems she's pretty	
				close with Sculp.	
0x5833	0x98	Lupus		I've got to gather information	
				for now...	
0x58b2	0x98	Lupus		Say, Nayuta...	
				Where did you get the medicinal herb	
				used to cure Eartha's illness?	
0x5923	0x98	Lupus		Is the fact I haven't seen Cygna around	
				connected in any way?	
0x5980	0x98	ALTO		Well, you see...	
0x59b0	0x98	Lupus		Haha, well that's fine.	
0x59e8	0x98	Lupus		Though there's various things that pique	
				my interest, in the end, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine.	
0x5a73	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you can talk about it,	
				please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5ae5	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah...It's a promise.	
0x5b5f	0x98	Lupus		The medicinal herb used to cure	
				Eartha's illness, and the reason	
				Cygna's not around...	
0x5bd4	0x98	Lupus		Though there's various things that pique	mp_0000 0x59e8
				my interest, in the end, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine.	
0x5c5f	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you can talk about it,	mp_0000 0x5a73
				please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5cf9	0x98	Lupus		Though there's various things that pique	mp_0000 0x59e8
				my interest, in the end, it's good	
				that everything worked out fine.	
0x5d84	0x98	Lupus		Well, when you can talk about it,	mp_0000 0x5a73
				please tell me.	
				I think my interest is deepening.	
0x5e2e	0x98	Dorado		Wha, Eartha collapsed～!?	mp_0000 0x37ae
0x5e69	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	mp_0000 0x37e9
				I-I'll go visit her soon!!	
0x5ebb	0x98	Lupus		It's good that Doctor Hydol	mp_0000 0x383b
				just arrived at the island.	
0x5f12	0x98	Lupus		Well, if it's Dorado's older brother,	mp_0000 0x3892
				you'd have to think that.	
0x5f99	0x98	Lupus		I'll go see how she's doing later.	
0x5fdc	0x98	Lupus		...But before that,	
				I've got to inform the old man.	
0x6065	0x98	Lupus		In this world, it seems there	
				are some who think,	
				"The world is a sphere."	
0x60ce	0x98	Lupus		Of course, there's people	
				who think differently, too.	
0x6123	0x98	Lupus		If the ground were round, the people	
				on the lower half would	
				fall off.	
0x6188	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, but...	
				You might be surprised to learn	
				that I think the world is round too.	
0x61f6	0x98	ALTO		See, the sea horizon	
				curves gently...	
0x623a	0x98	ALTO		This truth is such that wherever	
				you go in the world, it's the same.	
				No explanation can contradict it...	
0x62c0	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x62f3	0x98	Lupus		...Ah, I see, I see.	
				Good grief, even you say things I	
				don't understand sometimes.	
0x6364	0x98	Lupus		Hehe...As expected, you're	
				on a pretty strange heading,	
				Nayuta.	
0x63c2	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x63f4	0x98	ALTO		(Soundly rejected...)	
0x646b	0x98	Lupus		The curvature of the sea is just	
				an ordinary optical illusion...	
				That's what common sense says anyway.	
0x64f0	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, even you say things	
				I don't understand sometimes.	
0x6549	0x98	Lupus		Hehe...Well, I think you're	
				on a pretty strange heading.	
0x65c9	0x98	Lupus		So because the sea horizon curves,	
				the world is round, eh?	
0x6623	0x98	Lupus		Hehe...As expected, you're	mp_0000 0x6364
				on a pretty strange heading,	
				Nayuta.	
0x66b9	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, did you guys just now...	
				transport a small doll-like	
				thing to your house?	
0x6729	0x98	Lupus		Did you find it in the ruins?	
0x6767	0x98	ALTO		U-Uummm...	
				(A doll...he must be talking about Noi.)	
0x67b9	0x98	ALTO		(We wrapped her in cloth just to be sure	
				 and brought her to my house, but even so,	
				 there was a person who saw...)	
0x684a	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x687c	0x98	ALTO		(B-But...	
				 How should I explain this, I wonder?)	
0x68cb	0x98	Lupus		(...Hmmm,	
				 When things can't be explained,	
				 something must be behind it...)	
0x6935	0x98	Lupus		...Well, that's fine.	
				Show it to me sooner or later.	
0x6989	0x98	ALTO		OK, I will.	
0x69dc	0x98	Lupus		So there was a doll you guys	
				secretly transported from the	
				ruins...	
0x6a3e	0x98	Lupus		...Hehe, somehow, it seems like	
				something good will happen.	
0x6acf	0x98	Lupus		My master's stories,	
				and Dorado's fear...	
				These are fine.	
0x6b27	0x98	Lupus		But, as for the things that	
				happened when you guys returned...	
0x6b85	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, let's just say you lived up to	
				your reputation as a troublemaker.	
0x6bec	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6c1e	0x98	ALTO		(Such unthinkable accusations...)	
0x6c87	0x98	Lupus		But it's too bad.	
				If it's tourist season, it should	
				be even more exciting...	
0x6cf2	0x98	Lupus		Sightseeing fees...Hmmm...	
0x6d2d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6d95	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta.	
				You look well.	
0x6dcf	0x98	ALTO		You too, Lupus.	
0x6dfe	0x98	ALTO		...is what I want to say but,	
				why are you smiling happily	
				like that?	
0x6e60	0x98	Lupus		Oh, you want to know?	
0x6e96	0x98	Lupus		No matter what you say,	
				it's because a troublemaker like	
				you has returned to the village.	
0x6f0e	0x98	Lupus		It's because I'm excited for something	
				interesting to happen in this peaceful,	
				boring village of ours.	
0x6f93	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6fc5	0x98	ALTO		A troublemaker?	
				Maybe, if you're talking	
				about Cygna.	
0x7018	0x98	Lupus		No, no.	
				Though you might be unaware, you too have	
				plenty of that nature too, don't you think so?	
0x7097	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, so that's why I'm excited	
				for summer vacation.	
0x712d	0x98	Lupus		This village is too peaceful,	
				and a little boring.	
0x717f	0x98	Lupus		But you troublemakers,	
				Nayuta and Cygna,	
				have returned...	
0x71d7	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, so that's why I'm excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for summer vacation.	
0x7253	0x98	Lupus		This village is too peaceful,	mp_0000 0x712d
				and a little boring.	
0x72a5	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, so that's why I'm excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for summer vacation.	
talk_Aquela
0x7370	0x98	Aquela		My, you are...	
0x73a0	0x98	Aquela		Huhu, you have good eyes, don't you.	
0x73e6	0x98	Aquela		And so, this spinning star shows you	
				are burdened with a great fate.	
0x744b	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x747f	0x98	ALTO		Um, you are...?	
0x74ae	0x98	Aquela		Huhuhu...as an astrologer, I have	
				great interest in you.	
0x7507	0x98	Aquela		That's right young man.	
				I want you to keep this.	
0x7558	0xC1	System		obtained.	
0x75d7	0x98	Aquela		You will receive some very	
				interesting hints...	
				This is my thanks to you.	
0x7692	0x98	Aquela		...Though I didn't plan on visiting	
				this island again.	
0x76e9	0x98	Aquela		This presence...It seems some	
				fate has again begun to turn.	
0x7745	0x98	Aquela		Huhu, rest easy.	
				I don't intend to impede you.	
0x77bc	0x98	Aquela		It seems the fate that was severed from	
				the island has again begun to turn.	
0x7828	0x98	Aquela		My astrology did not see any omens.	
				It's possible some great	
				power is moving about.	
talk_Sculp
0x7935	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta,	
				I've got something I want you to hear.	
0x7988	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	
				What in the world is it?	
0x79cb	0x98	Sculp		The truth is, I heard this story	
				from Antlia recently...	
0x7a23	0x98	Sculp		It seems using fertile "soils"	
				will improve crops greatly.	
0x7a7d	0x98	Sculp		It's better than manure, and	
				it's pretty popular on the continent.	
0x7adf	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	
				I can't find much good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x7b57	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, eh?	
				I don't think I have any	
				good ideas.	
0x7bb0	0x98	ALTO		From the start, Remnant Island soil	
				is full of salt and hard, probably...	
0x7c18	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	
				It's probably as you say.	
0x7c75	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems I heard an	
				impossible story, eh? Sorry,	
				my bad.	
0x7cd2	0x98	Sculp		But if you get some good "soil"	
				somewhere, I'd be a help	
				if you could give me some.	
0x7d44	0x98	Sculp		Will you keep that in mind	
				for me?	
0x7d86	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	
0x7db3	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile "soil," was it?	
				 If I find some, I should try	
				 bringing it to Sculp, right?)	
0x7f0a	0x98	Sculp		Somehow, Bootie has gotten	
				fired up about helping with	
				the house.	
0x7f6a	0x98	Sculp		Maybe that kid who has been	
				nothing but trouble has	
				grown up a little.	
0x7fcf	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare	
				chance, I've got to teach	
				him well.	
0x8051	0x98	Sculp		Somehow, Bootie has gotten	mp_0000 0x7f0a
				fired up about helping with	
				the house.	
0x80b1	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare	mp_0000 0x7fcf
				chance, I've got to teach	
				him well.	
0x8141	0x98	Sculp		Oh, if it isn't Nayuta.	
				Thanks for helping me with milking	
				Jessica all this time.	
0x81b1	0x98	Sculp		If only Bootie would let me	
				teach him about work then...	
0x8209	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, it can't be helped.	
				Bootie's at the time in his life when	
				he only wants to play.	
0x827e	0x98	ALTO		I'll help you out with that	
				anytime you need, so	
				please ask me anytime.	
0x82e3	0x98	Sculp		Haha, I think I'll do that.	
0x8347	0x98	Sculp		I want to teach Bootie too, but	
				he's not the least bit interested.	
0x83a9	0x98	Sculp		Good grief, when it comes to	
				summertime, all I can do	
				is rely on you, Nayuta.	
0x8431	0x98	Sculp		I-It's cold!...What happened!?	
0x8470	0x98	Sculp		It's no good.	
				I've got to check on the fields...	
0x84c0	0x98	Sculp		For all the crops we grew	
				I can't afford to lose my babies.	
0x854f	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta.	
				If you're looking for Kureha, she passed	
				by here just a little while ago.	
0x85c3	0x98	Sculp		She said she was going	
				on an errand somewhere.	
0x8611	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...	
				Thanks, Sculp!	
0x8674	0x98	Sculp		Are you looking for her?	
0x86ad	0x98	Sculp		If that's the case, you might	
				want to look over there. She	
				hasn't returned yet.	
0x8751	0x98	Sculp		Today, that beautiful girl	
				helped me with the	
				harvesting work.	
0x87ae	0x98	Sculp		That girl said she was	
				staying at your place, but...	
				Is it really true?	
0x8814	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, various things	
				happened, and now	
				she is homestaying.	
0x886c	0x98	Sculp		Oh, is that right.	
0x889f	0x98	Sculp		Man, I was surprised when she	
				came to me saying she wants	
				to help, but...	
0x8907	0x98	Sculp		Thanks to her help, I finished work	
				quickly today. Yeah, she was a	
				big help.	
0x899a	0x98	Sculp		Kureha...I think was her name.	
0x89d9	0x98	Sculp		She's beautiful, graceful, and	
				above all, she's considerate.	
				Hmm, she's a good girl.	
0x8ab4	0x98	Sculp		Just now, Canie went	
				for a sick visit.	
0x8afa	0x98	Sculp		Though various trouble happened...	
				as long as we are able to help,	
				you can rely on us.	
0x8b97	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, everyone is searching	
				for a way to cure Eartha.	
0x8bee	0x98	Sculp		Though I don't have anything like a	
				vegetable that is effective, we'll see	
				if something like that exists.	
0x8c9c	0x98	Sculp		Eartha collapsed, didn't she.	
0x8cda	0x98	Sculp		Our Canie said she was going	
				for a sick visit but...	
				Is she not feeling well?	
0x8d46	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x8d78	0x98	Sculp		...Right...	
				Anyhow, cheer up.	
0x8ddd	0x98	Sculp		Though Eartha collapsed...	
				You should cheer up somehow.	
0x8e86	0x98	Sculp		We have a small field on the	
				rear side of the island.	
				Somehow, the weather's been strange lately.	
0x8f06	0x98	Sculp		Is strangely hot, with continuing rain...	
				Thanks to that, the vegetables	
				aren't doing so well.	
0x8f83	0x98	Sculp		However, I heard a rumor that the weather	
				is strange only on Remnant Island.	
0x8fef	0x98	Sculp		Here and there on the island, it's	
				strange this year, and everyone	
				is troubled.	
0x9085	0x98	Sculp		It seems the weather is strange	
				only on Remnant Island.	
0x90dc	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, working in the fields is difficult.	
				The gods in heaven do as they please.	
0x9166	0x98	Sculp		Man, that scared me.	
				It's the first time I've seen one that big.	
0x91c6	0x98	Sculp		...Anyhow, I've got to check the field	
				later to see if it was damaged.	
0x9260	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta!	
				As expected, in the little time I haven't	
				seen you, you've grown.	
0x92cc	0x98	Sculp		In an instant, you've become a giant	
				or something.	
0x931e	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...	
				You exaggerate too much, Sculp.	
0x9365	0x98	ALTO		Only four months have passed	
				since I left.	
0x93ae	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, I exaggerated a bit.	
				You're steadily growing	
				during your growth period.	
0x944d	0x98	Sculp		Come now, say hi to	
				Jessica for me.	
0x94b4	0x98	Cow		Moooooooo～...	
0x94e1	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...I'm back, Jessica.	
0x9551	0x98	Sculp		Well, you'll be here awhile during your	
				summer break, right? You should take	
				it easy.	
0x9606	0x98	Sculp		Since you'll be here awhile,	
				you should take it easy.	
0x965b	0x98	Sculp		Since it's your summer vacation,	
				don't let anything distract you.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x974f	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	
				Isn't that pretty good "soil!?"	
0x97a3	0x98	Sculp		It is dark, has a soft feel and has a fragrant	
				earthy scent... There's no mistake- It is	
				of excellent quality.	
0x9830	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, the truth is, I found it	
				someplace...	
0x987a	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's all right with you,	
				can I give it to you?	
0x9907	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	
0x993c	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x99b7	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha of the general	
				store came to tell me she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x9a31	0x98	Sculp		Because she said she wants to stock	
				my vegetables, I'm honored by the request	
				and I thought I would respond to it somehow.	
0x9aca	0x98	Sculp		Anyhow, you helped me out, Nayuta.	
				Please use this well for me.	
0x9b29	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	
0x9b66	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	
				I won't hesitate to tell you.	
0x9bbe	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	
				I'll look forward to then, Nayuta.	
0x9c4d	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	
				to the general store lineup.	
0x9c9e	0x07	System	#4C	If you give "soil" to Sculp,	
				the lineup of vegetables the general	
				store is able to sell will be enhanced.	
0x9d16	0x07	System	#4C	If you find "soil,"	
				proactively bring it here.	
0x9dac	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0x9e06	0x98	Sculp		If it's all right with you, please give it here.	
				I've again got some things I want to try	
				on the field.	
0x9e8c	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	
				If it is useful to you, Sculp.	
0x9f04	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this too is very fertile.	
0x9f44	0x98	Sculp		Alright...Time to go try it.	
0x9f81	0x98	Sculp		I've got to quickly sell the vegetables	
				I'm able to grow now.	
0xa012	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d
				to the general store lineup.	
0xa09d	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0xa0f7	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's of unthinkably	
				fine quality. ...Hmm, just where	
				on Remnant Island did you get his...	
0xa17c	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, various things happened.	
0xa1ba	0x98	ALTO		Anyhow, I'm giving this to	
				you, Sculp.	
0xa22e	0x98	Sculp		Thank you as always.	
				You're a great help.	
0xa277	0x98	Sculp		With just this good soil,	
				there's no mistake I can produce	
				even more vegetable varieties!	
0xa2ef	0x98	Sculp		Haha, as a farmer, I'm happy to	
				say that there's none better	
				than this.	
0xa355	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these raised	
				vegetables to the general store. Nayuta,	
				I'm glad you found this for me.	
0xa416	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

0xa7f5	0x98	Bootie		...Nayuta, you're always thinking	
				that I'm a child, aren't you.	
0xa855	0x98	Bootie		No way.	
				Even I help with the house.	
0xa899	0x98	Bootie		...Every once in awhile, that is.	
0xa8dc	0x98	ALTO		Haha, is that right.	
				You're growing, Bootie.	
0xa927	0x98	Bootie		...As I thought, you're irritating.	
0xa994	0x98	Bootie		Because I'm already 11,	
				I can look after Jessica	
				all by myself.	
0xa9f3	0x98	Bootie		I'll never again ask for help	
				from the Handyman Shop.	
				Remember that, Nayuta!	
0xaa95	0x98	Bootie		Ur-sa-mi-na-!	
				This stuff called	
				snow is COLD!!	
0xaae3	0x98	Bootie		...Achoo!!	
0xab0f	0x98	Bootie		Erm...	
				As I thought, I should wait at home...	
0xab85	0x98	Bootie		Though it's my first time seeing snow,	
				I finally understand it.	
0xabe5	0x98	Bootie		I don't like	
				cold things...	
0xac63	0x98	Bootie		Huh, didn't you see Cygna?	
0xac9f	0x98	Bootie		...I just saw him earlier, see─.	
				Somehow, he had a serious face, though.	
0xad09	0x98	ALTO		A serious face...?	
0xad3b	0x98	Bootie		Well, I don't really know, y'know.	
				I felt like it was hard to invite	
				him to play.	
0xadac	0x98	Bootie		Though he went to the beach once,	
				I haven't seen him since then.	
0xae0d	0x98	ALTO		Is that right...Thanks.	
0xae6c	0x98	Bootie		In this general store, there's	
				some "Star Shard" souvenirs	
				on display.	
0xaed2	0x98	Bootie		They're not the small ones I	
				throw away, and you can see	
				the other world properly in them.	
0xaf4c	0x98	Bootie		...Man, those are nice.	
				I haven't even found one...	
0xafd6	0x98	Bootie		D-Damn...	
				I want to go too...	
0xb014	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, no fair!	
				Take me with you!	
0xb057	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry, Bootie.	
				It's dangerous as you'd expect.	
0xb0a6	0x98	Bootie		...Damn it...	
				It's because the Handyman Shop's	
				doing it that you're so impertinent!	
0xb119	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb173	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, don't take so much of

0xb1bf	0x98	Bootie		Even I'll be after you-	
				I'll go see it, you hear!?	
talk_Pyxia
0xb25a	0x98	Pyxia		Huhu, I came again to	
				search for a picture subject.	
0xb2ad	0x98	Pyxia		In the art contest this year,	
				I'm sure I'll take first place.	
0xb30a	0x98	Pyxia		They will be no match for	
				I, who have stepped up to a chick	
				from the egg of an artist.	
0xb3a7	0x98	Pyxia		They will be no match for	mp_0000 0xb30a
				I, who have stepped up to a chick	
				from the egg of an artist.	
0xb41c	0x98	Pyxia		And, this year for sure,	
				I will become a chicken!	
0xb46d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb4d5	0x98	Pyxia		It seems the specialty product called	
				"Star Shards" project amazingly	
				beautiful scenery.	
0xb54c	0x98	Pyxia		Though it seems there are people	
				who sketch that scenery...	
				...I can't lose to them.	
0xb5bf	0x98	Pyxia		If it's like this, 	
				I'll have to make good use of my image,	
				and make the landscape only I can make!	
0xb641	0x98	Horolo		Pyxia, I think that's an abstract-.	
0xb6cc	0x98	Pyxia		Doing something like sketching	
				<Star Shard> scenery...	
				I think that's a pretty good idea.	
0xb744	0x98	Pyxia		Huhu, I can't lose...	
				As the egg of an artist.	
0xb792	0x98	ALTO		(Has an unseen challenger	
				 to my sister appeared?)	
0xb81f	0x98	Pyxia		You, thank you very much!	
0xb859	0x98	Pyxia		If I have these pigments, I should	
				be able to draw an amazing picture!	
0xb8d3	0x98	Pyxia	#18S	My goal is the chicken of the artist!	
0xb941	0x98	Pyxia		This is <Remnant Island>...	
				It sure is a carefree place.	
0xb999	0x98	Pyxia		Though it seems there's	
				various interesting things, too...	
0xb9f3	0x98	Pyxia		If it's this place,	
				I feel like a good inspiration	
				will spring forth!	
0xba7f	0x98	Pyxia		...Say, why is everyone	
				so down?	
0xbabf	0x98	Pyxia		Though, I'm not good with ink.	
talk_Horolo
0xbb48	0x98	Horolo		Pyxia,	
				so you made Remnant Island the	
				theme of your painting last year.	
0xbbaf	0x98	Horolo		With that, you took the special	
				prize in the small picture contest.	
0xbc13	0x98	Horolo		Huhu, I haven't ever once	
				not won a prize in a contest...	
0xbc6d	0x98	Horolo		I've got to do my best again	
				this year.	
0xbcb5	0x98	ALTO		(...Just now, didn't she say	
				 something amazing inadvertantly?)	
0xbd3b	0x98	Horolo		Since Pyxia is doing her best,	
				I've got to do my best too.	
0xbd96	0x98	Horolo		I should try to again	
				find a good motif.	
0xbe15	0x98	Pyxia		It seems the specialty product called	mp_0000 0xb4d5

				beautiful scenery.	
0xbe8c	0x98	Pyxia		Though it seems there are people	mp_0000 0xb54c

				...I can't lose to them.	
0xbeff	0x98	Pyxia		If it's like this, 	mp_0000 0xb5bf

0xc112	0x98	Horolo		Huhu, Pyxia,

0xc155	0x98	Horolo		I've got to say

0xc194	0x98	Horolo		You've got to cheer up too～.	
0xc1f7	0x98	Horolo		This time, it'll be a bigger

				on the continent.	
0xc25e	0x98	Horolo		Though with my friend Pyxia	
				I'm searching to see if there	
				are any good motifs...	
0xc2ce	0x98	Horolo		Somehow, it seems the people	
				of the village have gloomy faces.	
0xc32d	0x98	Horolo		Even though it's such a beautiful place...

0xc3b9	0x98	Horolo		Somehow, it seems the people	mp_0000 0xc2ce

0x658	0x06	ALTO		ANI_LOOK_AROUND	
0x685	0x98	ALTO	#0W	...A colorless...world...	
0x6c1	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Where in the world is this?	
0x74b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x773	0x98	ALTO		If I'm not mistaken, I fought that idol...	
0x84f	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x879	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x983	0x98	ALTO	#18S	──Kureha, Cygna!!	
0xc90	0x98	ALTO		Somehow, you were imprisoned!?	
0xce4	0x41	None	#3W#2E#6C#12S	...Na...yu...ta...#0E	
0xd7e	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xdbc	0x98	ALTO	#0W	...This voice is...	
0x1024	0x98	ALTO	#16S#400x#300y	...Noi!?	
0x10d0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x10fa	0x98	ALTO		You shouldn't have come	
				to the "Inner World"...	
0x1148	0x98	ALTO		Or, am I in the	
				outside world...?	
0x1190	0x06	Noi2		ANI_DENY	
0x11b6	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...No, Nayuta.	
				This is still inside the	
				"Inner World."	
0x120d	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Inside of that, this place	
				is a reproduction of "me."	
0x1264	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Furthermore, I am the Noi...	
				That adventured with you one	
				year ago.	
0x12e4	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x1334	0x98	ALTO		Now that you mention it,	
				your way of speaking is...	
0x13ac	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x13d2	0x98	ALTO		But why?	
				Why did you, at that time...?	
0x141f	0x06	Noi2		ANI_NOD	
0x1444	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Yeah, I disappeared.	
0x147b	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...No, I "should have"	
				disappeared...	
0x14ca	0x06	Noi2		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x14f4	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...I, must apologize	
				to you and everyone, Nayuta.	
0x1547	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Because the abnormalities	
				of the Astrolabe this time...	
				They were all my fault.	
0x15dd	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x160c	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Huh...	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x16ed	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...At that time, I was prepared	
				to disappear...	
0x175c	0x98	Noi2	#0W	However...At the moment I disappeared,	
				my memories of you all came to mind.	
0x180d	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Exchanging jokes with Cygna,	
				enjoying tea with Master Kureha...	
0x186e	0x98	Noi2	#0W	The memories of truly enjoying my	
				adventures with you, Nayuta...	
				There are too many of those to count...	
0x194b	0x06	Noi2		ANI_DENY	
0x1971	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...At that time, from the bottom of my heart,	
				I thought, "I don't want to disappear."	
0x19f0	0x98	ALTO	#1W#400x#300y	Noi...	mp_0005c 0x6fe1
0x1a2b	0x06	Noi2		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x1a55	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...I should have been prepared to disappear.	
				Even so, I rejected that.	
0x1adb	0x98	Noi2	#0W	The Astrolabe, misunderstanding	
				that order, "protected" my existence	
				inside of itself against my will.	
0x1b82	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Because of that...	
				That is the cause of the malfunction	
				inside the Astrolabe's systems.	
0x1c02	0x98	ALTO	#1W#400x#300y	...No way...	mp_0100b 0xe52
0x1d23	0x98	Noi2	#0W	When Master Cygna and Master Kureha came	
				to the Inner World, my existence realized...	
				They intended to save me.	
0x1db3	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Thanks to that, my body was	
				returned to the outside world, but..	
				In exchange, the Mythos were...	
0x1e3c	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...Everything is the result	
				of my lack of resolve.	
0x1e90	0x98	Noi2	#0W	I'm truly sorry...	
0x1f95	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x1fc7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x1fed	0x98	ALTO		...Noi, you're not at all bad.	
0x206f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x2099	0x98	ALTO		That you didn't want to disappear...	
				You didn't want to separate from everyone...	
				Of course you thought those things!	
0x2170	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x219a	0x98	ALTO		I too...Even Cygna and Kureha...	
				We all didn't want you to	
				disappear!	
0x2205	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x2239	0x06	Noi2		ANI_NOD	
0x225e	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...Thank you.	
				Those feelings alone are enough.	
0x239e	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x23d0	0x98	ALTO		Noi...!?	
0x24aa	0x98	Noi2	#0W	I don't have much more time...	
				I too have started to steadily degrade	
				due to the abnormalities of the Astrolabe.	
0x2587	0x98	Noi2	#0W	──Nayuta, that idol was my other self,	
				created due to the abnormalities of	
				the Astrolabe.	
0x2603	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Now that my armor is destroyed,	
				my true form should appear...	
0x26b6	0x06	Noi2		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x26e0	0x98	Noi2	#0W	If you just defeat it,	
				Masters Kureha and Cygna	
				can be released!	
0x278d	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Since it is you, Nayuta, I'm sure you can do it...	
				I believe in you!	
0x280f	0x98	ALTO	#1W#18S#400x#300y	Noi...!

0x64c	0x98	Aulbath		Though that Zext man is

0x6a6	0x98	Aulbath		Unbeknownst to us, Nayuta...	
				You, too, have become strong.	
0x6ff	0x98	Aulbath		If it is you, you can probably	
				defeat that man.	
0x750	0x98	ALTO		Yes, I absolutely

0x78f	0x98	ALTO		I want to speak with

0x8fa	0x98	Aulbath		I leave the rest to you, my pupil.	
0x93f	0x98	ALTO		...Yes!!	
0x9a1	0x98	Aulbath		I cannot help with	
				this injury...	
0x9eb	0x98	Aulbath		But if it is you, you should	
				be able to reach that man.	
0xa3b	0x98	Aulbath		...............

0xa8f	0x98	ALTO		(Master... Maybe he's

0xae9	0x98	ALTO		(...Cygna...)	
0xb3e	0x98	Aulbath		If you do not give up,

0xbb1	0x98	Aulbath		My pupil...show me you can do whatever	
				it takes to bring back that girl.

0x1036	0x98	ALTO		Yes, I received it	mp_0002 0x4515

0x1073	0x98	ALTO		I has been useful in my training.	mp_0002 0x4552
0x10b4	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, is that so...	mp_0002 0x4593

0x11ee	0x98	ALTO		Wha...a skill?	mp_0002 0x46cd

0x1af0	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	mp_0002 0x4fcf
				you will gain various benefits	
				by accumulating CHAIN.	
0x1b64	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	mp_0002 0x5043
				If you gain a benefit, it will be very	
				advantageous for you to continue fighting.	
0x1bfb	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be	mp_0002 0x50da
				interrupted after a fixed time.	
				It will also be interrupted if you take damage.	
0x1c82	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively,	mp_0002 0x5161
				you need to cooperate with your allies,	
				and figure how not to interrupt your attacks.	
0x1d28	0x98	Aulbath		There are stronger benefits	mp_0002 0x5207
				of CHAIN.	
0x1d6f	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or higher, earned experience will increase,	mp_0002 0x524e
				If CHAIN is 100 or higher, all sword attacks will be criticals.	
0x1e0b	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	mp_0002 0x52ea
				you will gain a benefit that steadily restores your stamina.	
0x1e91	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate that much,	mp_0002 0x5370
				these benefit should be your ally	
				in tough battles.	
0x1f15	0x98	Aulbath		Bear in mind that when you are aiming at something,	mp_0002 0x53f4
				aim at it with a positive attitude.	
0x1fa4	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash "Spinning Cut,"	mp_0002 0x5483
				you can hit even 	
				flying enemies.	
0x2005	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch	mp_0002 0x54e4
				small enemies into the sky.	
				If you master it, it will improve your battles.	
0x2085	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible to launch	mp_0002 0x5564
				large-build enemies. You should	
				bear that in mind.	
0x211c	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique, "Vacuum Blade," that is	mp_0002 0x55fb
				unleashed when CHAIN is 20 or higher, it has even more power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x21f7	0x98	Aulbath		"Down Thrust" is an attack that grows in strength	mp_0002 0x56d6
				with the force of the drop.	
0x2266	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is that,	mp_0002 0x5745
				of all the sword techniques, it	
				boasts the highest attack power.	
0x22eb	0x98	Aulbath		Though it leaves a large gap,	mp_0002 0x57ca
				there are many chances to use it.	
				Please try using it in your own way.	
0x2390	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Meteor Attack" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x586f
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x246f	0x98	Aulbath		"Kamaitachi" is unleashing an	mp_0002 0x594e
				intense stroke of your sword	
				with a quick step.	
0x24dd	0x98	Aulbath		This technique with strong sword power	mp_0002 0x59bc
				can damage enemies against which sword	
				attacks are ineffective.	
0x2564	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, that power extends over a wide range.	mp_0002 0x5a43
				The possibility of long-range attacks	
				is a feature of this technique.	
0x261e	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Whirlwind" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x5afd
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x26f9	0x98	Aulbath		"Swallow Return" is cutting	mp_0002 0x5bd8
				down all surrounding enemies	
				in an instant.	
0x2761	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling surrounding enemies	mp_0002 0x5c40
				towards you. In melee, it exhibits a terrible power.	
0x27ed	0x98	Aulbath		Though among the sword techniques it is the	mp_0002 0x5ccc
				most difficult, if you master it, it will be a strong power.	
				Do not tire of this, and endeavor to train.	
0x28c2	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Fallen Lotus" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x5da1
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x29a0	0x98	Aulbath		Among swords there exist	mp_0002 0x5e7f
				"One-Handed Swords" and	
				"Two-Handed Sword."	
0x2a05	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords are maneuverable	mp_0002 0x5ee4
				and can unleash quick, successive attacks.	
				Generally, you can say they are easy to handle.	
0x2aa3	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have high attack power,	mp_0002 0x5f82
				and easily bringing down enemies is their characteristic.	
				However, they leave a large gap and are hard to handle.	
0x2b72	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	mp_0002 0x6051
				I cannot say which is superior.	
				You should choose a sword which is easy for you to use.	
0x2c2d	0x98	Aulbath		Among monsters there are those	mp_0002 0x610c
				which can cause various abnormal	
				statuses.	
0x2c97	0x98	Aulbath		There is "poison" which saps your stamina,	mp_0002 0x6176
				and "paralysis" which substantially lowers	
				your movement ability...	
0x2d26	0x98	Aulbath		"Freeze" which stops your movements,	mp_0002 0x6205
				and "confuse" which derails your actions.	
0x2d96	0x98	Aulbath		Though with time, all are restored,	mp_0002 0x6275
				there exists equipment which offers	
				resistance and recovery items.	
0x2e1d	0x98	Aulbath		If you are heading to a dangerous	mp_0002 0x62fc
				battle, you should get your	
				preparations in order.

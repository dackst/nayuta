0x107a	0x98	ALTO		...The surroundings have

0x114c	0x98	ALTO	#240x#500y	As for what I see over there...	
				It's the surface of our world, right?	
0x1244	0x98	ALTO	#0x#500y	...Somehow, even the	
				flowers are glowing softly.	
0x12a3	0x98	NOI	#500x#500y	That white flower is a species

0x1b03	0x06	NOI		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x1b2c	0x98	NOI		As I thought...

0x1bd5	0x98	ALTO		Underground!?	
0x1c9e	0x40	NOI		What we have been exploring up until

0x1d00	0x40	NOI		That is, the "surface" of ancient times,	
				for preserving the plants and animals, but...	
0x1eb1	0x40	NOI		This is the lower stratumâ”€	
				Star Capital Lexendria.	
0x1f04	0x40	NOI		A residential area created for the humans.	
0x1f55	0x40	ALTO		Star Capital...Lexendria...	
0x1f98	0x40	NOI		It supposedly named after an ancient continent.	
0x1fe8	0x40	NOI		There are four "Pillars" that supply each

0x27fc	0x98	NOI	#6A	There's an elevator to the

0x2859	0x98	NOI	#6A	For those other than the Mythos	
				to use it, four Stellagears are

0x28d7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1

0x2938	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2961	0x98	NOI	#6A	They form a pair with the

0x29bf	0x98	NOI	#6A	If we put them in the

0x2a21	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x2a4a	0x98	NOI	#6A	They are probably hidden in the

0x2d5d	0x98	Asa		Come to think of it, your

0x2db0	0x98	Asa		To think that you could improve this

0x2e60	0x98	ALTO		Haha, what are you saying.	
				I still have a ways to go

0x2f82	0x98	ALTO		That's right...from here on,

0x2fdf	0x98	ALTO		I've been requesting the fundamentals

0x3397	0x98	Asa		Haha, I know.

0x36d6	0x98	Asa		It's been awhile since I examined	
				a Star Shard as good as the one today.	
0x373c	0x98	Asa		Though they're not related by blood,	
				Orvus is still Cygna's father.	
0x379d	0x98	Asa		Huhu, somehow, I'm jealous.	
0x37ff	0x98	Asa		It's been awhile since I examined	mp_0110 0x36d6

0x3865	0x98	Asa		Nayuta, please save	
				Cygna and Kureha.	
				For Orvus too.	
0x38dc	0x98	Asa		To be able to meet Noi	
				again like this...	
				I'm truly happy.	
0x3933	0x98	Asa		On top of that, it's possible	
				Kureha and Cygna might	
				be able to be saved...	
0x399b	0x98	Asa		This time it'll be difficult too,	
				so do your best, you two!	
0x3a1c	0x98	Asa		It's possible	
				Kureha and Cygna might	
				be able to be saved...	
0x3a74	0x98	Asa		Though it'll be difficult,	
				do your best, you two!	
0x3afb	0x98	Asa		Lyra's waiting	
				on the cape, isn't she?	
0x3b3f	0x98	Asa		Huhu, don't be late for your date.	
				You shouldn't keep girls waiting.	
0x3bc9	0x98	Asa		Lyra's waiting	
				on the cape, isn't she?	
				You shouldn't keep girls waiting.	
0x3c64	0x98	Asa		Why the long faces?	
				Did something happen?	
0x3cab	0x98	Asa		Might you possibly have been able	
				to meet Kureha?	
0x3cfa	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, we were able to meet her	
				and confirm her feelings, but...	
0x3d58	0x98	ALTO		(In the end, we just had one step	
				 left, but weren't able to save her...)	
0x3dc0	0x98	ALTO		(And, as for the true form of	
				 this planet that we saw...	
				 I shouldn't tell her.)	
0x3e2f	0x98	NOI		(Hmm...As you'd expect,	
				 we panicked.)	
0x3e73	0x98	Asa		...Somehow, it seems that	
				a devastating event occurred.	
0x3ec8	0x98	Asa		But, if you were able to meet	
				Kureha, it's a step forward.	
0x3f20	0x98	Asa		If it's Nayuta and Noi, I'm sure	
				you will be able to bring back	
				those two. So, cheer up.	
0x3f95	0x98	ALTO		...Yeah, you're right.	mp_0004n 0x1712
0x3fcb	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I've got to think

				Let's get ready, Noi!	
0x402c	0x98	NOI		Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x408a	0x98	Asa		If it's Nayuta and Noi, I'm sure	
				you will be able to bring back	
				those two.	
0x40f1	0x98	Asa		Therefore, absolutely	
				never give up.	
0x4133	0x98	Asa		Your sister, Lyra and everyone	
				are looking forward to your	
				return.	
0x41ba	0x98	Asa		You two, absolutely never	
				give up.	
0x41fa	0x98	Asa		...Father and mother in heaven,	
				please protect Nayuta.	
0x4284	0x98	Asa		Now, now, don't just sit there.	
				You'll bring back Kureha and	
				Cygna for me, right?	
0x42f2	0x98	Asa		If it's you two, I'm sure you'll	
				be fine. Your sister believes	
				in you.	
0x4355	0x98	Asa		Prepare properly, and then	
				get going.	
0x43c0	0x98	Asa		If it's you two, I'm sure	
				you'll be fine.	
0x4407	0x98	Asa		I'm sure you'll save everyone	
				and return safely.	
				...Your sister believes in you.	
0x44aa	0x98	Asa		For a change of pace,	
				you two should walk	
				through the village together.	
0x450e	0x98	Asa		When they learn that you've	
				awakened, all of the villagers	
				will be delighted.	
0x4578	0x98	Asa		You were looked after by various	
				people, so be sure to thank them,	
				OK?	
0x4603	0x98	Asa		For a change of pace,	mp_0110 0x44aa
				you two should walk	
				through the village together.	
0x4667	0x98	Asa		You were looked after by various	mp_0110 0x4578
				people, so be sure to thank them,	
				OK?	
0x4700	0x98	Asa		I shouldn't have been	
				separated from Kureha	
				like this.	
0x4753	0x98	Asa		Though it was a short time,	
				I spent time with her and	
				came to understand her.	
0x47bd	0x98	Asa		Nayuta, definitely bring Kureha	
				back with you.	
0x4831	0x98	Asa		I shouldn't have been	mp_0110 0x4700
				separated from Kureha	
				like this.	
0x4884	0x98	Asa		Nayuta, definitely bring Kureha	mp_0110 0x47bd
				back with you.	
0x48ec	0x98	Asa		Something like snow...	
				Though I heard stories	
				about it from father...	
0x494e	0x98	Asa		This maybe connect to	
				those rumors about	
				the strange weather...	
0x49de	0x98	Asa		It seems Kureha is surveying	
				various things in the village.	
0x4a37	0x98	Asa		If she is not on the "other side,"	
				it would be very strange.	
0x4a91	0x98	Asa		And sometimes, she tells	
				me about the work she helps with.	
				Huhu, she is a very good girl.	
0x4b2f	0x98	Asa		It seems Kureha is surveying	mp_0110 0x49de
				various things in the village.	
0x4b88	0x98	Asa		Sometimes, she tells	
				me about the work she helps with.	
				Huhu, she is a very good girl.	
0x4c16	0x98	Asa		Oh, Nayuta...	
				If it's Kureha,	
				she went out, correct?	
0x4c67	0x98	Asa		It looks like she went	
				on a walk through the village.	
0x4cba	0x98	Asa		Huhu, if you run, I think	
				you can meet her somewhere.	
0x4d41	0x98	Asa		Because she said she wants to	
				try cooking, I'll teach her little by	
				little.	
0x4da9	0x98	Asa		Huhu, it seems like Kureha	
				has a knack for it too.	
0x4df9	0x98	Asa		Though she's still not on Lyra's	
				level...It seems that she'll be	
				a good bride someday㈱

0x4f79	0x98	Asa		Huhu, anyway,	
				please leave Kureha	
				to me.	
0x4fbe	0x98	Asa		You should do what you need	mp_0110 0x4f09
				to do, Nayuta.	
0x503c	0x98	Asa_b		Please bring Kureha	
				here for me.	
0x507c	0x98	Asa_b		She helped me so much.	
				I want to thank her personally.	
0x50d2	0x98	Asa_b		Most of all, I want to look at	
				the person who made me well.	
0x5155	0x98	Asa_b		Then, please bring that message	
				to the girl called Kureha.	
0x51af	0x98	Asa_b		Huhu, I'm looking forward to this.

0x536c	0x98	Asa		Huhu, it looks like I won't have to	
				close my Star Shard observation

0x53d6	0x98	Asa		Nayuta, Noi.	
				Truly, thank you.	
0x543a	0x98	Asa		If more work comes in,

0x5489	0x98	Asa		Nayuta, Noi.	mp_0110 0x53d6
				Truly, thank you.	
0x54eb	0x98	Asa		Hehe, leave everything about	
				Noi to me.	
0x5530	0x98	Asa		When customers come,	
				I'll have her hide in my room,	
				so I think everything will be all right.	
0x55a9	0x98	Asa		Something like a fairy...as you might expect,	
				that would cause a huge ruckus.	
0x5614	0x98	ALTO		You're right about that...	
				Anyway, thanks for your help Eartha.	
0x569a	0x98	Asa		Leave everything about Noi to me.	
				I will take responsibility	
				for entertaining her.	
0x5709	0x98	Asa		Hehe, she is very cute and	
				I welcome her㈱	
0x5789	0x98	Asa		Hehe, in these past four months,	
				Lyra's cooking has gotten	
				quite good too.	
0x57f0	0x98	Asa		I wonder if it will soon be time	
				for her to have you try it,	
				Nayuta.	
0x5851	0x6B	Lyra		Unknown	
0x58a6	0x98	Lyra		Hey...Eartha!	
				I told you it's still too early for that!!	
0x58fd	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x596f	0x98	Asa		By the way...Nayuta,	
				he didn't return, did he?	
0x59bb	0x98	Asa		I didn't think Cygna	
				would return so	
				suddenly.	
0x5a3e	0x98	Asa		My, it doesn't look like	
				Cygna is with you.	
0x5a87	0x98	Asa		Hehe, even though it just restarted,	
				I wonder if the Handyman Shop	
				will be busy.	
0x5af4	0x98	ALTO		...Haha, I guess it will be.	
0x5b30	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna...	
				 I've got to meet up with him quickly.)	
0x5ba8	0x98	Asa		Hehe, even though it just reopened,	
				it looks like the Handyman Shop	
				is busy.	
0x5c11	0x98	Asa		When you need a lunch box, ask me anytime.	
				I'll put plenty of love inside♪	
0x5cb0	0x98	Asa		It looks like you two went on an	
				adventure somewhere again.	
0x5d09	0x98	Asa		I can't stop warning you even though	
				you won't listen if I tell you.	
				Don't get into anything too dangerous, OK?	
0x5d95	0x98	Asa		...Hehe, since you are already 15, maybe	
				I don't need to worry so much.	
0x5dfa	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I'm alright.	
				I'll be careful.	
0x5e3c	0x98	ALTO		(...Is what I have to say,	
				 so it doesn't become	
				 like last time.)	
0x5ec4	0x98	Asa		Anyway, don't get into anything	
				too dangerous.	
0x5f10	0x98	Asa		I'll make a lunch box for you,	
				so be careful and have	
				a good trip.	
0x5fbf	0x98	ALTO		Huh, Eartha?	
				I you haven't left yet.	
0x600d	0x6B	Asa		Surprise	
0x6072	0x98	Asa		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x609a	0x98	Asa		Yes, though I talked about work	
				with Antlia, I was worried about	
				the house and slipped out.	
0x6112	0x98	Asa		More importantly...That was a	
				huge quake! Are you two all right!?	
0x6171	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, both me and Cygna are all right.	
0x61b7	0x98	ALTO		And listen to this Eartha!	
				A huge ruin fell near the cape,	
				and I went to see it with Cygna!	
0x6230	0x6B	Asa		Sweatdrop	
0x6261	0x98	Asa		...Phew, if the situation's like	
				that, it seems you'll get hurt.	
0x62bf	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...Sorry, it was against	
				my better judgment...	
0x6311	0x98	Asa		No, it's fine as long as you're safe.	
0x6355	0x98	Asa		I'll take care of the fallen pot	
				and cleaning up the bookshelf.	
				You two go to the ruins.	
0x63ca	0x98	ALTO		Yeah...Thanks Eartha.	
0x6427	0x98	Asa		Though I discussed the next job	
				with Antlia, I was worried about	
				the house and slipped out.	
0x649f	0x98	Asa		I'll clean up quickly	
				and get back to him.	
0x64e7	0x98	Asa		You too Nayuta...Don't do anything	
				dangerous.	
0x657a	0x98	Asa		It seems Dorado has asked me	
				to make a lunch box for him.	
				Huhu, well done.	
0x65e1	0x98	Asa		From now on, I'll make many lunch	
				boxes for you, so look forward to it.	
0x6688	0x98	Asa		You two returned home safe and sound.	
				I'm kind of relieved.	
0x66e1	0x98	Asa		It's because you didn't send me	
				so much as a letter until it came	
				time for your summer vacation.	
0x675e	0x98	ALTO		Haha...sorry Eartha.	
				You're always thinking of yourself.	
0x67b5	0x98	Asa		Now, your sister would	
				never say something like that.	
0x6808	0x98	Asa		But...it would be good to tell of	
				your return to father and mother too.	
0x686d	0x98	Asa		If you have time later,	
				how about going to the graves	
				on the cape?	
0x68cc	0x98	ALTO		That's right...	
				I'll try going during a break from	
				handyman work.	
0x6965	0x98	Asa		Oh yes! Today I'm meeting a merchant	
				to to deliver an analyzed Star	
				Shard.	
0x69ce	0x98	Asa		So, I need you to watch the house this	
				morning, and I promise I'll make you	
				something good come noontime.	
0x6a54	0x98	Asa		Look forward to it, Nayuta.	
0x6a8e	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, yeah.	
				I'm excited.	
0x6aee	0x98	Asa		Oh yes! Today I'm meeting a merchant to	
				to deliver some analyzed Star	
				Shards.	
0x6b5a	0x98	Asa		I even drew some excellent sketches of	
				the scenes that can be seen inside.	
0x6bc2	0x98	Asa		Haha, it would be good if	
				he liked them.	
talk_Asa_Signa_sub
0x6c10	0x98	Asa		...I see, you two are off exploring

0x6c69	0x98	Signa		W-Well,	
				Well, how should I say this...	
0x6caf	0x98	Signa		Right, it was like that.	
				Of course, the Handyman Shop	
				gets nothing but rave reviews!	
0x6d22	0x98	Asa		Huhu, it's too bad you two haven't	
				changed since you were kids.	
0x6d7f	0x98	Asa		You were always exploring ruins	
				or whatever, keeping it a secret	
				from me and the village adults.	
0x6dfc	0x98	Asa		You were saved from tight sports	
				by Orvus, with this sort of scary	
				face...	
0x6e63	0x6B	Signa		Sweatdrop	
0x6e96	0x98	Signa		F-Forgive us, Eartha.	
				I'm telling you, we're	
				not kids anymore...	
0x6ef5	0x98	ALTO		(Haha...It seems my sister is	
				 being decieved by Cygna.)	
0x6f4c	0x98	ALTO		(Though he doesn't talk about the other world,	
				 it's no lie that we're exploring...	
				 It won't be suspicious if I request a lunch box.)

				 I haven't gone against Eartha.)	
0x71b6	0x98	Signa		(Anyhow, I've got to deceive her	
				 well about that other world.)

talk_Dorado
0x7285	0x98	Dorado		E-Eartha...	
				Ah, this is no good!	
				I'm imagining terrible things!	
0x72e4	0x98	Dorado		Hey, Eartha was	
				saved, wasn't she!?	
0x7328	0x98	ALTO		(I'll show you I can save her,	
				 definitely!)	
0x739b	0x98	Dorado		Somehow, it seems a way to cure	
				Eartha can't be found...	
0x73f4	0x98	Dorado		Please, god...	
				I don't care what ruins or whatever you	
				send us, but please wake her up...	
talk_Lupus
0x749b	0x98	Lupus		I can't believe Eartha

				I reject this kind of event.	
0x755f	0x98	Lupus		...*cry*...	mp_0100 0x1bc54
0x75b3	0x98	Lupus		Why did this happen

0x75f3	0x98	Lupus		Damn, I've really done it now.	
talk_Antlia
0x7660	0x98	Antlia		I can't believe Eartha has

0x76b6	0x98	Antlia		...I have no words.	
0x76eb	0x98	Antlia		Yupina Grass...	
				It seems there are those who know about	
				it, but obtaining it will be difficult...	
0x7794	0x98	Antlia		As for whether you can get Yupina Grass,	
				it seems there are those who know about

0x782e	0x98	Antlia		...Nayuta, you shouldn't get your

talk_Keny

0x35d30	0x98	NOI	#6A	It said that if I bring Mr. Nayuta,

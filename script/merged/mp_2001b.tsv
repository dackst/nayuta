0x1c78	0x06	NOI		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x1ca1	0x98	NOI	#6A	Maybe it used to be

0x1db0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x1dd8	0x98	ALTO		Now that you mention it, it seems

0x1e45	0x98	ALTO		Maybe this is the world	
				made by the Mythos...	
0x1e93	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1ebd	0x98	ALTO		Haha, it seems devices even more

0x1f28	0x98	ALTO		Someday, I want to

0x203c	0x98	ALTO		...Sorry.	
				We've got to concentrate on

0x2098	0x98	ALTO		First up, we've got to do something

0x2213	0x98	NOI	#6A	This power I received from Gio

0x227e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x22a3	0x98	ALTO		Oh, that's right.

0x22fa	0x06	NOI		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x2323	0x98	NOI	#6A	...You're right.	
				We can't proceed like this...	
0x237a	0x98	ALTO		It might be good to

				for the time being.	
0x23d2	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x23fc	0x98	ALTO		Next, want to try

0x344a	0x41	None	#0W#2E#029c	...And, of all things, to misrepresent

0x351a	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x353e	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah...	
				We can't leave things like this.	
0x35a4	0x98	NOI	#6A	But...I expect those people	
				plan to stop this continent's	
				Temple as well.	
0x362c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The situation is the same as before,	
				so it's a strong possibility.	
0x3698	0x41	None	#0W#2E#029c	...Noi, and Nayuta too.	
				For now anyway, hurry and	
				head for the Temple.#0E	
0x3779	0x41	None	#0W#2E#029c	Since there has not been much

0x3847	0x41	None	#0W#2E#029c	I entrust everything to you.

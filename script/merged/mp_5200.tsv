0x2c7b	0x06	Zext		ANI_SIT2_NOD	
0x2cad	0x98	Zext		...Hehe, very well, then.
				The plan has already entered

0x2ce0	0x98	Zext		There is nothing you could do now to stop it.	
0x2f12	0x98	Zext		Human child, you do not know the

0x2f6f	0x98	Zext		Long ago...we Mythos also

0x2fd4	0x98	ALTO	#16S#240x#270y	!?	
0x300c	0x98	Zext		Mythos once coexisted with "Humans."	
0x3052	0x98	Zext		In those days, we gave out the	
				vast knowledge and technology	
				we possessed.	
0x30c2	0x98	Zext		Furthermore, by manipulating the Power

0x313c	0x98	Zext	#0W	Those people worshipped us	
				...as a race of "gods".	
0x319c	0x98	ALTO	#0W#240x#270y	A race...of gods...	
0x3240	0x40	ALTO		Then...

0x33e3	0x98	Seram		Hehe, an image of the	
				Mythos guiding your world.	
0x3440	0x98	Seram		Well, relations between people	
				and gods were going well.	
0x3498	0x98	Seram		...Until that time came.	
0x34db	0x98	Creha		One day...humans made a mistake.	
0x3522	0x98	Creha		As a result...they caused a	
				huge calamity for the world.	
0x357d	0x98	Creha		The beautiful nature and civilization that	
				we built were destroyed all too quickly...	
0x35e4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Was this the legendary calamity...!?	
0x3631	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Are you saying it was caused	
				by the hands of humans!?	
0x3709	0x98	Zext		Whether you believe it or not,	
				it actually happened.	
0x37c8	0x98	Zext		...However, we had predicted	
				this to some extent...	
0x3811	0x98	Zext		So we created the plan to be	
				executed in the case that
				calamity strikes.	
0x3882	0x98	NOI	#1W#20x#270y	Pl..an...	
0x38be	0x98	Zext		We created a beautiful world to preserve	
				every plant and animal that existed at the time, 
				so that we could one day reconstruct it.	
0x393e	0x98	Zext		And thus, we laid the foundation for one

0x3a07	0x98	Zext	#1W	That is the #0WTerra plan.

0x3e95	0x98	Zext		The Astrolabe in this tower has an important

0x4bef	0x98	Zext		The fact that humans had survived

0x4c6c	0x98	Zext		It would be no big problem if

0x63cd	0x98	Creha		Wait... This is irrelevant to the plan.	
0x6466	0x98	Zext	#6A	Hehe, what's wrong...?

0x666e	0x98	Zext	#6A	Noi is a being originally

0x66ce	0x98	Zext	#6A	In order to help achieve the

				go against their orders.	
0x6739	0x98	Zext	#6A	For this reason, she chose

0x67b8	0x98	Zext	#6A	In other words, Noi herself

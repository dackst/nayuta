talk_Puppis
0x4a9	0x98	Puppis		Everywhere on the Ciencia Sea,	
				animals are starting to disappear.
0x525	0x98	Puppis		...It's almost like the legendary	
				Great Flood is happening again.	
0x594	0x98	Puppis		With no wings or gills,	
				we're stuck to living	
				on our feet on land.
0x620	0x98	Puppis		According to legend, the	
				world was once destroyed	
				by a Great Flood.	
0x687	0x98	Puppis		Us, without wings or gills,	mp_0003c 0x594
				even so, have to stick to	
				land and live.	
0x721	0x98	Puppis		You guys fell from the broken	
				moon, but you were fine.
				How did you even survive?	
0x777	0x98	Puppis		Just how high is that thing?	
				No mortal being could have	
				survived such a fall..	
0x7e7	0x98	Puppis		Maybe you guys are being	
				protected by some kind of god.
0x858	0x98	Puppis		Maybe some kind	mp_0003c 0x7e7
				of god is protecting	
				you.	
0x8a1	0x98	Puppis		A god that's still watching out for us!	
0x915	0x98	Puppis		Hey, boy.	
				...You seem down.	
0x950	0x98	ALTO		Haha... D-Does it	
				look that way?	
0x990	0x98	NOI		C-Captain.	
				It's been a while.	
0x9ca	0x98	Puppis		Oh, the fairy's with you.	
				You two seem to be a bit	
				tense, don't you think...?	
0xa30	0x98	Puppis		Hmph, well, whatever.	
				I don't have enough space in my	
				head to worry about that, too.	
0xa7f	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xab1	0x98	ALTO		"Too...?" What do	
				you mean by that?	
0xb03	0x98	Puppis		Well, rumor has it... war	
				has finally broken out on	
				the North Continent.	
0xb65	0x98	Puppis		The conflict was magnified	
				by civil unrest due to these	
				abnormal weather conditions.	
0xbc6	0x98	Puppis		Saint Cerise is packed with fleeing	
				noble refugees, too... But this	
				island is still peaceful, though.	
0xc3f	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that so...?	
				War at a time like this...	
0xc98	0x98	NOI		Humans are still foolish after all.	
				I don't understand it...	
0xcf0	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0xd1a	0x6B	NOI		Ellipsis	
0xd4b	0x6B	Puppis		Sweatdrop	
0xd7f	0x98	Puppis		...Sorry if it's making you depressed.	
0xdbf	0x98	Puppis		Forget about what I just said.	
				It's not for you kids to worry about.	
0xe11	0x98	Puppis		Adults who only care about themselves	
				are just freaking out a little bit.	
0xe94	0x98	Puppis		The war is because neighboring countries	
				blamed the broken moon and the abnormal	
				weather on each other.	
0xf0f	0x98	Puppis		There's no way human beings could have	
				caused a worldwide incident like these.	
				Dammit, they need to calm down for a sec.	
talk_Crux
0xfd7	0x98	Crux		It's already time to set sail, but	
				it looks like a rough storm is brewing	
				offshore, so we can't leave.	
0x1055	0x6B	Crux		Ellipsis	
0x1087	0x98	Crux		...Th-This is a bad idea, isn't it?	
0x10cd	0x98	Crux		What if the storm continues to get	
				worse and starts coming this way...!	
0x1142	0x6B	Crux		Sweatdrop	
0x1174	0x98	Crux		M-Maybe I'm overthinking	
				things. Hahahaha...	
0x11e6	0x98	Crux		Even during a time like this,	
				the people of Remnant Island and	
				in no hurry to start panicking...	
0x1249	0x98	Crux		Ooh, I've got to follow	
				their example a little more.	
0x12d2	0x98	Crux		That reminds me, in Saint Cerise,	
				a huge monster appeared and caused	
				quite a scare.	
0x1346	0x98	Crux		The city guard did everything	
				they could to contain it, but...	
0x13a5	0x98	Crux		That kind of thing is	
				happening all over the	
				place. It's out of control.	
0x141b	0x98	Crux		The captain's tough as	
				nails, but the only weapon	
				he's got is an oar...
0x147c	0x98	Crux		...I wonder how long this	
				situation will continue...	
0x1512	0x98	Crux		Because of extreme weather,	
				the ocean currents off the	
				coast have become violent.	
0x157a	0x98	Crux		Sailing has also become difficult.	
				It takes twice as long to get places	
				than it usually does.	
0x15e6	0x98	Crux		...Well even so, the captain	
				refuses to stop his ship.	
0x1669	0x98	Crux		So that this small island won't	
				get stuck and isolated, we'll	
				brace ourselves and keep sailing...	
0x16e0	0x98	Crux		Well, that's what	
				the captain says.	
talk_Axe
0x17aa	0x98	Axe		Nayuta...Looks like	
				you're awake.	
0x17e4	0x98	Axe		You guys washed up on the cape	
				a little while after the	
				incident started.	
0x184c	0x98	ALTO		I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x1879	0x98	Axe		It's been pretty rough out at sea,	
				but you got here in one piece.	
0x18d0	0x98	Axe		We've got to thank the gods.	
0x190a	0x98	NOI		(Master Kureha... She cast a	
				 spell on us so we would make	
				 it safely to Remnant Island.)	
0x1974	0x98	ALTO		(Why would she do that...?)	
0x19cb	0x98	ALTO		(...Kureha...)	
0x1a33	0x98	Axe		Though I'm glad you	
				guys are safe...	
0x1a75	0x98	Axe		The fishing hasn't been very great	
				lately with these conditions.	
0x1ac5	0x98	Axe		It's not that I can't catch any, but we	
				can't produce the usual amount without	
				increasing the number of fishing trips.	
0x1b54	0x98	Axe		Sometimes I catch some kind of weird	
				deep-sea fish I've never seen before...	
				I don't know what the hell is going on.	
0x1bfa	0x98	Axe		This strange weather can't	
				be any good for fishing.	
0x1c4b	0x98	Axe		It's like all the fish are going away.	
				I don't know what the hell is going on.	
talk_Carina
0x1cde	0x98	Carina		Nayuta... You're up now.	
0x1d33	0x98	Carina		I was really worried about you.	
0x1d74	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I'm sorry.	
0x1da5	0x98	baby		Abu, abu...	
0x1dd0	0x98	NOI		Wha... You can't grab my hair!	
0x1e19	0x98	Carina		Heheh, it looks like	
				Collie likes you, Noi.	
0x1e5e	0x98	Carina		...Anyway, both of you should	
				get yourselves plenty of rest.	
0x1eb2	0x98	ALTO		...Yes.	mp_0002 0x90fc
0x1f01	0x98	baby		Abu, abu...	mp_0003c 0x1da5
0x1f2c	0x98	Carina		Heheh, Collie likes you, Noi, huh?	
0x1f73	0x98	Carina		...Anyway, you two.	mp_0003c 0x1e5e
				Get your bodies plenty of rest.	
talk_Bell
0x1ff5	0x98	Bell		There aren't enough fish left	
				to catch, so Dad goes out	
				fishing every day and night....	
0x2061	0x98	Bell		He's working even more than	
				before, and can't spend time	
				with me anymore, but...	
0x20bc	0x6B	Bell		Ellipsis	
0x20ee	0x98	Bell		...Vel is fine!	
				I'm helping Dad.	
0x213b	0x98	Bell		When I grow up... Vel is going	
				to be a fisherman just like Dad!	
0x21c2	0x98	Bell		Vel will help Dad someday.	
0x21ff	0x98	Bell		mp_0003c 0x213b	
talk_Vavo
0x22a4	0x98	Vavo		The phenomenon where large quantities of debris	
				fell from the sky seems to have ended, but...	
				I do not think it's over with just this.	
0x2334	0x98	Vavo		As for what will come next...	
				Examining the rubble may prove	
				effective in predicting that.	
0x23cc	0x98	Vavo		It's times like these are an	
				academic's time to shine. I	
				must do my part well.	
0x246b	0x98	Vavo		It's precisely because of this baffling situation	
				that we find ourselves in that academics should	
				be able to relieve some of the insecurities.	
0x24f6	0x98	Vavo		Nayuta, as always, I would
				appreciate your help.	
0x2579	0x98	Vavo		Hmm, it's fortunate that not that not	
				much rubble has not hit the museum.	
0x25d3	0x98	Vavo		However, from a research angle,	
				this is very intriguing...	
				If I investigate this thoroughly...	
0x264f	0x98	Vavo		...Oops, that was inappropriate.	
				Sorry, it slipped out...	
0x26ce	0x98	Vavo		These mysterious ruins seem to have	
				fallen not only on the Ciencia Sea,	
				but all throughout the world.	
0x2758	0x98	Vavo		There's heavy damage everywhere...	
				It was inappropriate to be pleased	
				in their falling.	
talk_Camelope
0x280c	0x98	Camelope		I had a long discussion with Sasha,	
				and she decided to return and visit	
				the family home.	
0x287f	0x98	Camelope		The House of Camelope is a prominent trading	
				family in charge of a vast trade network...	
				We have plenty of stockpiled goods.	
0x2905	0x98	Camelope		...Shall I will return immediately	
				and order the stock to be released?	
0x298c	0x98	Camelope		I have been worried about Sasha...	
				But instead, I only ever told her	
				what to do as the head of the family.	
0x2a0f	0x98	Camelope		Heheh, that girl has grown up already.	
0x2a69	0x98	Camelope		...Now, let's go	
				and check up on her.	
0x2abe	0x98	Camelope		I hope she is well...	
talk_Norma
0x2b42	0x98	Norma		The Mistress is known among	
				her relatives for her stubborn	
				and headstrong will.	
0x2bae	0x98	Norma		Persuading her to change...	
				Ooh, Milady has grown up	
				to be a fine young woman.	
0x2c13	0x98	Camelope		...Norma, what was that?	
0x2ca2	0x98	Norma		Huh!? I-It was nothing!	
0x2d01	0x98	Norma		A-Anyway I will return	
				to the mansion for now.	
0x2d52	0x98	Norma		I understand Master Nayuta will be	
				heading off to stop these anomalies...	
				Please, take care of yourself.	
0x2e00	0x98	Norma		There was terrible damage to the mansion	
				on the continent. We had returned to the
				family home for a time...	
0x2e7e	0x98	Norma		However, the Mistress insisted	
				on checking up on Milady again,	
				no matter what.	
0x2efa	0x98	Norma		Hehe, even in these circumstances,	
				she brought me too.	
0x2f70	0x98	Norma		Even so, I have no idea why	
				the ferry is still operating	
				in these conditions.
0x2fd8	0x98	Norma		It is a real mess back	
				on the continent...

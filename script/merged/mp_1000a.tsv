0x114d	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x11ae	0x98	NOI		Nayuta, what's wrong?	
0x121a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Noi, is it okay if I try planting	
				this sapling here?	
0x1270	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x1294	0x98	NOI		Hmm, I think so,	
				if it's only that, but...	
0x12eb	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1314	0x98	NOI		Just what are you planning?

0x1375	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hehe, look forward to that later.

0x239e	0x98	Signa		Hmmm...	
				We sure got here in

0x2429	0x98	Signa		Hey, are you all right, Nayuta?	
0x24a3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_TIRED_WAIT	
0x24cf	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ah, no, I was just a little	
				surprised by the transporter device...	
0x2533	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I guess I'm not used to the	
				sensation of my body being	
				hurled at high speeds.	
0x25e7	0x98	NOI	#6A	Geez, humans are so unkempt...	
0x265d	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Hey, it looks like	
				Cygna is relatively fine.	
0x26e5	0x98	Signa		Oh, yeah.	
0x270f	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2737	0x98	Signa		It might be because I train daily	
				in the vigilante corps.	
0x2798	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ahaha, Cygna...	
				I've got to get used to this quickly too.	
0x280f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0x2840	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Anyhow,

0x2907	0x98	ALTO		The cherry trees are blooming	
				and it's a very beautiful place.	
0x2979	0x98	ALTO		It also looks like plants we	
				haven't seen before are	
				growing all over the place...	
0x29e9	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2a11	0x98	ALTO		In a place like this, I'd like to	
				try flower viewing with Eartha	
				and Lyra maybe...	
0x2aa6	0x98	NOI	#6A	Beautful is beautiful but...	
				To me, it's weird.

0x2b44	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2b6d	0x98	NOI	#6A	Normally, there should be a	
				verdant green forest beneath the	
				sun's rays in this season.	
0x2c01	0x98	NOI	#6A	But, due to the Master Gear	
				being stolen, the climate is	
				going crazy in a big way.	
0x2c7d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2ca7	0x98	ALTO		Sudden abnormal weather has	
				destroyed this ecosystem...	
				It's not a good situation.	
0x2d3c	0x98	NOI	#6A	Anyway, we must hurry	
				and take back the	
				Master Gear...!	
0x2d95	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x2dbe	0x98	NOI		Let's depart immediately, you two!	
				Zext should definitely be	
				further ahead!	
0x2e2e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2e53	0x98	ALTO		Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x2e80	0x06	Signa		ANI_JOY	
0x2ea6	0x98	Signa		It looks like there are monsters here.	
				We should proceed with caution.	
0x2f5e	0x07	System	#4C	[NOI] has been added to the camp menu.	
					
0x2f9b	0x07	System	#4C	Noi has been added to your companions,	
				and you can now control her.	
0x2fec	0x07	System	#4C	Noi is a partner who can fight	
				using magic called "Arts."	
				Use her well with Nayuta to proceed ahead.	
0x3315	0x07	System	#4C	Stage clear status is now	
				displayed on the sub-menu.	
0x3357	0x07	System	#4C	Additionally, location movement buttons	
				have been added to the sub-menu.

0x3c73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3c9d	0x98	ALTO		That thing over there looks like...	
				another transporter device.	
0x3d03	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x3d2c	0x98	NOI	#6A	If you use that, you	
				can proceed deeper in.	
0x3df6	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x3e1c	0x98	NOI	#6A	Speaking of Zext...	
				Where is he planning on going with	
				the Master Gear I wonder...	
0x3f22	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x3f4a	0x98	Signa		Anyway, it looks like he's no	
				longer here. Let's keep	
				going forward.	
0x3fb5	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0x4029	0x6B	Signa		Surprise	
0x407b	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT	
0x40bf	0x98	Signa		Oh, right...Nayuta,	
				I'm giving you this.

0x41ce	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558
0x4368	0x40	ALTO		Oh, this is...	
				Isn't this the fencing training	
				book you use all the time?	
0x43cf	0x40	ALTO		It's for recording training events	
				by putting stamps on them...	
0x4435	0x40	Signa		Yeah, I received it from Master and	
				I've been using it this whole time.	
0x449c	0x40	Signa		I think it's about time	
				I turned it over to you.	
0x455c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x458b	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that really ok!?	
				Someone like me	
				getting this...	
0x45e6	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x460e	0x98	Signa		Hey, hey, why are you surprised?	
				You are Master's pupil too,	
				and you are natural with a sword.	
0x468b	0x98	Signa		I've mostly finished my training.	
				You should use it.	
				I'm sure you'll find it useful.	
0x46fe	0x98	Signa		...Nayuta, when you've accumulated training	
				stamps, you should show them to Master.	
				He'll give you some training advice, probably.	
0x47a7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x47cc	0x98	ALTO		Okay, got it.	
				Well then, thank you	
				for letting me have this.	
0x482e	0x98	Signa		Yeah, do your best for me.	
0x487f	0x98	Signa		Sorry Noi, I lost track of time.	
				Let's get going!	
0x48e4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e

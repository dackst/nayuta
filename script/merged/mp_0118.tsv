0xb61	0x98	NOI		Though it's pretty old,

0xbd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, though we used this

0xc93	0x98	NOI		No...I think it's impossible.

0xcf9	0x98	NOI		It's likely that, a year ago, it

0x5062	0x98	Aulbath	#0W#6A	──Some years ago,	
				a short time after I had	
				started to live on the island...	
0x50d6	0x98	Aulbath	#0W#6A	On one occasion when I was	
				exterminating monsters, I found	
				this place by chance.	
0x51bf	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	There, I found a boy who looked as though	
				he had jumped out of the "gate."	
0x522e	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Why in the world was he here... Thinking that,	
				I decided to peer through the gate.	
0x535d	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	...What was there,	
				was an exceedingly beautiful world.	
0x53b8	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	It was like the world of Lost Heaven	
				that you can see through the Star Shards...	
				I had a hunch that it was that very place.	
0x5459	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	However, I...	
				I sensed something terrifying and	
				immediately retraced my steps.	
0x54cb	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Immediately after that, this gate	
				lost its light. It did not connect again.	
0x55fb	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	As for the boy, the village looked after him,	
				and he had lost all his memories.	
0x566f	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	...I took the responsibility of watching	
				over him until he became an adult, or	
				until he regained his memories.	
0x5701	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Cygna Alhazen...	
				Naming him so, I taught him how to live from zero.	
0x5781	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	From there, Cygna met Nayuta...

0x587d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x58a2	0x98	ALTO	#0W	So that's what happened...	mp_0101 0x8b6b

				Cygna was originally from Terra.	
0x5987	0x98	Aulbath	#6A	Now that he has regained his

0x472	0x98	ALTO		Though I'm worried about this place...	
				Now, I'm more worried about the village.	
0x4e0	0x98	NOI		Yeah, if I think about the worst	
				when Master Kureha is there...	
0x53d	0x98	NOI		For now, let's return to the village	
				and see how things are!

0xd65	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0xd8c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	So this is the temple of <La Worg>...	
0xdd4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0xe17	0x98	ALTO		From looking at it, it looks like	
				it hasn't been shut down yet.	
0xe7d	0x06	NOI		ANI_DENY	
0xea2	0x98	NOI	#6A	But, it's overflowing with lava	
				more than the other places on	
				this continent...	
0x1165	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x118e	0x98	NOI	#6A	I'm sure the inside will be	
				even more dangerous.	
0x11ef	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x121c	0x98	ALTO		Alright, let's proceed with caution──	
0x134a	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x1374	0x6B	NOI		Exclamation	
0x1515	0x98	ALTO	#0W#500x#500y	Y-You are...!	
0x1557	0x98	NOI	#0W#300x#500y	Selam──Master Selam...	
0x15a3	0x98	Seram		Hehe, we meet again.	
0x15e0	0x06	Seram		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x160b	0x98	Seram		That you have chased us this	
				far means that you're bad	
				at giving up...	
0x17a6	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x17d0	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Have you come to shutdown	
				this temple?	
0x1823	0x06	Seram		ANI_NOD	
0x1849	0x98	Seram		Precisely.	
0x18b4	0x98	Seram		If we shut down this temple,	
				all the continent's <Power of Stars>	
				will flow into a single point...	
0x193d	0x98	Seram		To do that is the most important	
				preparation for releasing the seal	
				on <Terra>.	
0x19b3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x19db	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The "Seal"...	
				It was as Nemeas said...	
0x1a48	0x6B	NOI		Ellipsis	
0x1ac3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x1b87	0x98	NOI		...Truly...	
0x1bc7	0x06	NOI		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x1bf0	0x98	NOI		Are you guys really planning	
				to use *that*!?	
0x1c79	0x98	Seram	#6A	Yes, we are.	
				Without the slightest hesitation.	
0x1cd2	0x06	Seram		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1cfd	0x98	Seram	#6A	That is because there is	
				something that we...	
				that the <Mythos> must do.	
0x1d6f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x1d95	0x98	ALTO		W-Wait just a moment.	
				What is *that*?	
0x1e11	0x98	ALTO		Noi, do you know something!?	
0x1e4d	0x6B	NOI		Unknown	
0x1eb6	0x98	NOI	#0W#6A	...Well, you see...	
0x1ef6	0x06	Seram		ANI_LAUGH	
0x1f1e	0x98	Seram	#6A	Hehe...	
				As I thought, you didn't tell him.	
0x20e2	0x98	Seram		No matter.	
				This time, I came to	
				warn you two.	
0x213e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2168	0x98	ALTO	#6A	A warning...?	
0x21b7	0x98	Seram		As for our plan,	
				it's doing very well.	
0x2212	0x98	Seram		Zext, who is not here,	
				is starting to prepare to obtain	
				the <Key> that will release the seal.	
0x228e	0x06	Seram		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x22b9	0x98	Seram		To you guys, from here on	
				it's a domain you can't predict.	
0x231b	0x98	ALTO	#6A	A-A key?	
0x234e	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2377	0x98	NOI	#6A	W-What are you saying!?	mp_0101 0x1f77e
0x23b8	0x06	Seram		ANI_WAIT	
0x23df	0x98	Seram		Hehe, you don't know?	
0x2415	0x06	Seram		ANI_DENY	
0x243c	0x98	Seram		In that kind of situation,	
				your gaze is captured by	
				the <Master Gear>...	
0x24ab	0x98	Seram		But, is it alright to take your	
				eyes off that which is important	
				to you?	
0x251a	0x98	Seram	#0W	.........	mp_0101 0x2297d
0x254f	0x06	Seram		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x257a	0x98	Seram	#0W	──I'm talking about Remnant Island.	
0x25cb	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x25fd	0x6B	NOI		Exclamation	
0x262e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x265d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...!?	mp_4002a 0x12a4
0x268d	0x06	NOI		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x26b6	0x98	NOI	#0W#6A	W-What do you mean!?	
0x271d	0x98	Seram		Hehe, I'll let you proceed	
				into the temple like this.	
0x2799	0x98	Seram		What you must do...	
				Think over it carefully.	
0x29f5	0x98	ALTO		There he went...	
0x2a42	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Hey, Nayuta.	
0x2a96	0x98	NOI	#6A	I...There are various things	
				I haven't told you...	
0x2b29	0x98	ALTO		...Yes, that's fine.	
0x2b5d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2b87	0x98	ALTO		I said it before, but...	
				if you feel like it,	
				you can tell me.	
0x2beb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2c13	0x98	ALTO		...More importantly,	
				I'm worried about his words.	
0x2c63	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x2c89	0x98	NOI	#6A	Though he said it seems like 	
				something is happening on	
				Remnant Island...	
0x2cfa	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2d23	0x98	NOI	#6A	I'm worried about Master Kureha too...	
0x2d73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2d98	0x98	ALTO		...It can't be helped, let's return to	
				that world for now.	
0x2df1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2e1b	0x98	ALTO		We've got to confirm the condition of	
				Kureha and Remnant Island...	
0x2f47	0xCE	Objective		I'm worried about the island and Kureha. Let's return to check.	
EV_4_S15_temple4_front
0x32d7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0x32fe	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It's super hot here,	
				as always, but...	
0x336c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3396	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It looks like they haven't yet been	
				able to stop the flow of the <Power of	
				Stars>.	
0x3441	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x346a	0x98	NOI		Let's hurry and overtake Master Selam!	
0x34af	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x34d8	0x98	NOI		Let's go, Nayuta!	
				To recover the final <Master Gear>!

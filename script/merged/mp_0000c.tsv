talk_Dorado
0xb7b	0x98	Dorado		I was just about to leave	
				on patrol with Axe and	
				the others, but...	
0xbde	0x98	Bootie		...Hey, don't ignore me.	
				Take me with you too!	
0xc2d	0x6B	Dorado		Sweatdrop	
0xc8f	0x98	Dorado		Ah, you're annoying!!	
				This is a job for adults!	
0xcdf	0x98	Dorado		Generally, in front of monsters,	
				you run away and are scared	
				of them.	
0xd6c	0x98	Dorado		This time, only ferocious monsters	
				are coming out. We've got to increase	
				our patrols.	
0xde1	0x98	Dorado		I've got to fulfill my duty	
				as town guard!	
talk_Lupus
0xe72	0x98	Lupus		That rubble won't move no matter what.	
				I thought of asking my mom	
				for help.	
0xee1	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0xf14	0x98	Lupus		...My god, it	
				actually moved...	
0xf7c	0x98	Lupus		Even Columba and Sculp	
				couldn't move that rubble...	
0xfcf	0x98	Lupus		So the unthinkable	
				hidden ball was this	
				close...	
0x1054	0x98	Lupus		Just in time, Doctor. The	
				old man is calling for you.	
0x10af	0x98	Lupus		As the village elder, he	
				wants to hear more about	
				your doctor's rounds.	
0x10fd	0x98	Hydol		I see... I was thinking I	
				had something to ask of
				him as well.		
0x1154	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	
				All right, let's go there now..	
0x1211	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, leave the	
				island to us for now.	
0x1258	0x98	Lupus		Don't overdo it, okay?	
talk_Canis
0x12bd	0x98	Canis		*huff, huff, huff*	
				I thought I'd try to get	
				rid of this rubble, but...	
0x1317	0x98	Canis		As I thought, these thin arms	
				can only it a little at a time.	
0x1373	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x13a6	0x98	Lupus		(I-I can't believe it... She's	
				 really moving it by herself...)	
0x142c	0x98	Canis		Even if I'm not useful,	
				I'm doing all I can to help.	
0x1480	0x98	Canis		Nayuta and everyone are	
				doing their best too...	
				I can't lose hope!	
talk_Columha
0x1503	0x98	Columha		I tried cleaning up this rubble	
				with the help of some of the stronger	
				people in the village...
0x156a	0x98	Columha		...But as expected, it's difficult.	
				They seem impossible to remove	
				by human hands...	
0x15d0	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time,	
				it seems like all we can do	
				is crush them with a hammer.	
0x1662	0x98	Columha		We're doing our best trying to	
				clean up this rubble somehow...	
				But just pushing it seems difficult.	
0x16de	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time,	mp_0000c 0x15d0
				it seems like all we can do	
				is crush them with a hammer.	
talk_Ursaminor
0x17b9	0x98	Ursaminor		Though the world has become	
				like this, I'm glad I met my	
				sister.	
0x181c	0x98	Ursaminor		...If she can make amends with	
				my father, I'll be even happier.	
talk_Ursaminor_and_Reticul
0x188b	0x98	Ursaminor		Reticul, I'm glad you're safe...	
0x18d0	0x98	Ursaminor		I was really worried about you...	
0x1916	0x98	Reticul		Ursamina...	
				Yeah, I'm really sorry.	
0x195b	0x98	Reticul		I'll help out with restoration	
				of the village, so there's	
				no need for you to worry.	
0x19cf	0x98	Ursaminor		...Did you make up	
				with father?	
0x1a12	0x98	Reticul		N-No...	
				As you might expect, it's a little	
				difficult to look him in the eye you know...	
0x1a8a	0x98	Reticul		W-Well, sooner or later I will, OK?	
talk_Sculp
0x1c12	0x98	Sculp		Say Nayuta,	
				There's something I want you to hear.	
0x1c63	0x98	ALTO		Huh, me?	
				What could it possibly be?	
0x1ca5	0x98	Sculp		The truth is, recently I heard	
				a story from Antoria, but...	
0x1d00	0x98	Sculp		If I used more fertile "soil,"	
				I'd definitely be able to	
				raise vegetables better.	
0x1d70	0x98	Sculp		Though using fertilizer is	
				fairly popular on the continent.	
0x1dcb	0x98	Sculp		However, I can't find very good	
				soil on Remnant Island...	
				Nayuta, do you have any idea about this?	
0x1e4c	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh...?	
				I'm afraid I don't have any idea.	
0x1ea7	0x98	ALTO		Originally, the soil on Remnant Island	
				everywhere is full of salt and hard...	
0x1f13	0x98	Sculp		As I thought...	
				If you say it, then it must be true.	
0x1f67	0x98	Sculp		Ah, it seems I've asked the	
				impossible of you.	
				Sorry, forget it.	
0x1fc6	0x98	Sculp		But if you get some good "soil"	
				somewhere, it'll be a help if	
				you give a little to me.	
0x203b	0x98	Sculp		Won't you keep that in mind	
				for me?	
0x207e	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x20ab	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile "soil," was it...?	
				 If I find some, shall I	
				 bring it to Sculp?)	
0x2253	0x98	Sculp		Hmm...It seems like I'll	
				need to remove that stone.	
0x22a6	0x98	Sculp		I can't believe there exists a human	
				who could move that by themselves.	
0x230d	0x98	Axe		Next is the one that fell near	
				your cow shed I guess...	
0x2362	0x98	Axe		When I'm done with my rounds,	
				I'll meet you there. We've got to	
				do something soon.	
0x240c	0x98	Sculp		Nayuta, I'm worried about the village.	
				We will show you we can protect	
				the place that you'll return to.	
0x2492	0x98	Sculp		So be absolutely sure	
				to return safely for us.	
0x2516	0x98	Sculp		Monsters I haven't seen before	
				are infesting this place.	
				Though I told him to be careful...	
0x2590	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, I'm glad Bootie's safe.	
0x25d0	0x98	Sculp		However...It would be good if	
				the kids didn't go outside for	
				awhile.	
0x265b	0x98	Sculp		Only monsters we can't make	
				a dent in are coming out now.	
0x26b4	0x98	Sculp		Though Orvus is making his rounds,	
				the kids should stay inside.	
0x2749	0x98	Sculp		Oh...What should I do?	
				Of all things, this huge	
				stone had to fall...	
0x27ac	0x98	Sculp		Well at least Jessica's safe,	
				and I can repair this shed	
				anytime.	
0x280c	0x98	Sculp		More importantly,	
				I've got to think of the village.	
0x28ab	0x98	Sculp		That's right, our vegetables haven't	
				wilted due to this weather.	
0x290b	0x98	Sculp		That might be because of the	
				soil you brought me, Nayuta.	
0x2964	0x98	Sculp		...Thank you, Nayuta!	
0x29c2	0x98	Sculp		I'll repair the field and look after Jessica.	
				...After that, I'll try to move the stone	
				in the plaza with everyone.	
0x2a54	0x98	Sculp		Man, I'll have to brace myself	
				for being busy.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x2af2	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good "soil!?"	
0x2b46	0x98	Sculp		It is dark, has a soft feel and has a fragrant	mp_0000 0x97a3
				earthy scent... There's no mistake- It is	
				of excellent quality.	
0x2bd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, the truth is, I found it	mp_0000 0x9830
				someplace...	
0x2c1d	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's all right with you,	mp_0000 0x987a
				can I give it to you?	
0x2cab	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	mp_0000 0x9907
0x2ce0	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	mp_0000 0x993c
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x2d5b	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha of the general	mp_0000 0x99b7
				store came to tell me she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x2dd5	0x98	Sculp		Because she said she wants to stock	mp_0000 0x9a31
				my vegetables, I'm honored by the request	
				and I thought I would respond to it somehow.	
0x2e6e	0x98	Sculp		Anyhow, you helped me out, Nayuta.	mp_0000 0x9aca
				Please use this well for me.	
0x2ecd	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	mp_0000 0x9b29
0x2f0a	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	mp_0000 0x9b66
				I won't hesitate to tell you.	
0x2f62	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	mp_0000 0x9bbe
				I'll look forward to then, Nayuta.	
0x2ff1	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d
				to the general store lineup.	
0x3042	0x07	System	#4C	If you give "soil" to Sculp,	mp_0000 0x9c9e
				the lineup of vegetables the general	
				store is able to sell will be enhanced.	
0x30ba	0x07	System	#4C	If you find "soil,"	mp_0000 0x9d16
				proactively bring it here.	
0x3150	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0x31aa	0x98	Sculp		If it's all right with you, please give it here.	mp_0000 0x9e06
				I've again got some things I want to try	
				on the field.	
0x3230	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	mp_0000 0x9e8c
				If it is useful to you, Sculp.	
0x32a9	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this too is very fertile.	mp_0000 0x9f04
0x32e9	0x98	Sculp		Alright...Time to go try it.	mp_0000 0x9f44
0x3326	0x98	Sculp		I've got to quickly sell the vegetables	mp_0000 0x9f81
				I'm able to grow now.	
0x33b7	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d
				to the general store lineup.	
0x3442	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0x349c	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's of unthinkably	mp_0000 0xa0f7
				fine quality. ...Hmm, just where	
				on Remnant Island did you get his...	
0x3521	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, various things happened.	mp_0000 0xa17c
0x355f	0x98	ALTO		Anyhow, I'm giving this to	mp_0000 0xa1ba
				you, Sculp.	
0x35d4	0x98	Sculp		Thank you as always.	mp_0000 0xa22e
				You're a great help.	
0x361d	0x98	Sculp		With just this good soil,	mp_0000 0xa277
				there's no mistake I can produce	
				even more vegetable varieties!	
0x3695	0x98	Sculp		Haha, as a farmer, I'm happy to	mp_0000 0xa2ef
				say that there's none better	
				than this.	
0x36fb	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these raised	mp_0000 0xa355
				vegetables to the general store. Nayuta,	
				I'm glad you found this for me.	
0x37bc	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

talk_Bootie
0x3b83	0x98	Bootie		Hey Nayuta, what are you doing looking	
				at me like that...	
				There's no way I'll stay at home!	
0x3bfe	0x98	Bootie		If I don't stand up at a time like this,	
				I'm not a man.	
0x3c56	0x98	Bootie		And so,	
				Remnant Island patrol, start!	
0x3c9c	0x98	Dorado		I said, stay at home!	
0x3cfb	0x98	Bootie		...Even I have some strength.	
0x3d3a	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, leave everyone in	
				this village to me!	
talk_Aquela
0x3db6	0x98	Aquela		My, you...	
0x3de2	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, you have good eyes, don't you?	
0x3e1d	0x98	Aquela		And so, in my reading of the stars,	
				I can see you are one burdened	
				with a great destiny.	
0x3e92	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x3ec6	0x98	ALTO		Y-You are?	
0x3ef0	0x98	Aquela		Hehehe... As an astrologer, I	
				take great interest in you.	
0x3f40	0x98	Aquela		That is how it seems to me, boy.	
				I want you to keep this.	
0x3f85	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558
0x4004	0x98	Aquela		I get some very interesting	
				premonitions from you...	
				This is thanks for that.	
0x40bc	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x40f0	0x98	Aquela		...It is passed down that my	
				clan made a grave error in	
				the distant past.	
0x4159	0x98	Aquela		Because of that, disaster struck,	
				and the world was enveloped in	
				ocean...	
0x41c6	0x98	Aquela		For generations, my tribe has since	
				secretly watched over this world and	
				passed down this tale through the ages.	
0x4237	0x98	Aquela		Though much time has passed and most of	
				the lore has been lost,	this is our	
				duty as descendants of the criminals.	
0x42d6	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x4300	0x6B	NOI		Surprise	
0x4331	0x98	ALTO		(T-Then...Noi, could this person...)	
0x4379	0x98	NOI		(Be a descendant of the humans	
				 who caused the great war	
				 of the past...?)	
0x43dd	0x98	NOI		(I-It's not impossible...Maybe.)	
0x4429	0x98	Aquela		I am sure my ancestors will be 	
				watching over you as you go about	
				the mission you two must complete...	
0x44a3	0x98	Aquela		I will not inquire into to the 	
				details, but please do your best.	
0x453f	0x98	Aquela		Huhu, this kind of story all of	
				a sudden makes me surprised.	
0x459c	0x98	Aquela		However, if I look at your face,	
				I can see the story is truthful.	
0x45fe	0x98	Aquela		Though I do not know the details	
				of your mission... I feel it is connected	
				with our dearest wish.	
0x467f	0x98	Aquela		...Our wish to someday, be forgiven	
				for that eternal crime.	
0x4703	0x98	Aquela		Though I do not know the details	
				of your mission...	
				Please do your best.	
0x476b	0x98	Aquela		Our ancestors, who regret their

0x480b	0x98	Aquela		I can see...inside of your hearts,	
				an illuminating fiber of intent.	
0x486e	0x98	Aquela		Although it is thin and unreliable,	
				it is an essential ray of hope	
				necessary for moving forward.	
0x48f5	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, I wonder towards what kind	
				of future it will it lead you...?	
				Once again, brace yourself.	
0x4994	0x98	Aquela		I can see...inside of

0x49f2	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, I wonder towards what kind	mp_0000c 0x48f5	
				of future it will it lead you...?	
				Once again, brace yourself.	
0x4a9f	0x98	Aquela		Stones pouring from heaven,

0x4b60	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x4b94	0x6B	NOI		Surprise

talk_Hydol
0x4f43	0x98	Lupus		Just in time, Doctor.

0x4f92	0x98	Lupus		As the village elder, he	
				wants to hear more about

0x5003	0x98	Hydol		I see... I was thinking I	
				had something to ask of
				him as well.	
0x505b	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	
				All right, let's go there now.	
0x5124	0x98	Hydol		Though they were not particularly	
				injured, I just examined Lyra and	
				Vel to make sure,
0x5197	0x98	Hydol		That they're safe after meeting	
				a monster that strong is thanks	
				to you, Nayuta.	
0x5206	0x98	Hydol		Please continue to protect	
				everyone with your strength,	
				you two.	
0x528d	0x98	Hydol		Tthere has been a rapid	increase

talk_Reticul

				You worried me.	
0x541f	0x98	Reticul		In the end, we didn't have	
				time to wait for you two...	
0x5477	0x98	Reticul		I worried the whole time	
				about you somehow coming back.	
0x54d0	0x98	ALTO		I'm sorry...But,	
				I'm glad you're safe too.	
0x5519	0x98	Reticul		Hmm, as I thought,	
				it looks like you're a little down.	
0x5571	0x98	Reticul		Well, that happens sometimes.	
				You should rest easy for awhile.	
0x55f9	0x98	Reticul		I wonder if I can make up with father...	
				Hmm, I've got to think about it, but...	
0x566b	0x98	Reticul		For right now, I don't want	
				to face him that much.	
				He seems seriously mad.	
talk_Axe
0x5749	0x98	Axe		To move this stone

0x578f	0x98	Axe		Though it's little by little,

0x57e6	0x98	Axe		Heh, Remnant Island will be	
				back to normal in no time.	
0x5862	0x98	Axe		If we put our strength together,	
				we should be able to overcome

				And restore peace on Remnant Island.	
talk_Pyxia
0x5986	0x98	Pyxia		The people of this island

				stand up to hardship...	
0x5a48	0x98	Pyxia		I've finally managed to

0x5ac3	0x98	Pyxia		I've finally managed to	mp_0000c 0x5a48
				decide what I want to paint.

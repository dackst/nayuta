talk_Dorado
0xb7b	0x98	Dorado		I was just about to leave	
				for patrol with Axe and	
				the others, but...	
0xbde	0x98	Bootie		...Hey, don't ignore me.	
				Take me with you too!	
0xc2d	0x6B	Dorado		Sweatdrop	
0xc8f	0x98	Dorado		Ah, you're so annoying!!	
				This is a job for adults!	
0xcdf	0x98	Dorado		Besides, didn't you just get scared	
				when I was attacked by that monster	
				the other day?	
0xd6c	0x98	Dorado		Lately, a lot of ferocious monsters	
				have been appearing. We've had to	
				increase our patrols.	
0xde1	0x98	Dorado		I've got to fulfill my duty	
				as the town guard!	
talk_Lupus
0xe72	0x98	Lupus		That rubble just wouldn't budge.	
				I thought it'd be funny to ask	
				my mom to help, but...	
0xee1	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0xf14	0x98	Lupus		...I never thought should she	
				could actually move it...	
0xf7c	0x98	Lupus		Not even Columba and Sculp together	
				could move that rubble...	
0xfcf	0x98	Lupus		There's a freaking secret weapon	
				hiding in town...	
0x1054	0x98	Lupus		Just in time, Doctor. My	
				grandpa wants to see you.	
0x10af	0x98	Lupus		As the village elder, he	
				wants to hear more about	
				your doctor's rounds.	
0x10fd	0x98	Hydol		I see... I wanted to ask	
				him some questions as well.		
0x1154	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	
				All right, let's be on our way.	
0x1211	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, we can handle	
				the island for now.	
0x1258	0x98	Lupus		Just don't push yourself too hard, okay?	
talk_Canis
0x12bd	0x98	Canis		*huff*, *huff*, *huff*	
				I thought I'd try to clear	
				out this rubble, but...	
0x1317	0x98	Canis		It looks like these slender womanly	
				arms of mine can only do so much.	
0x1373	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x13a6	0x98	Lupus		(I-I can't believe it...	
				 She's really moving it	
				 all by herself...)	
0x142c	0x98	Canis		I may not much use, but	
				I'll do all I can to help.	
0x1480	0x98	Canis		Nayuta and everyone else	
				are working so hard...	
				I can't get complacent!	
talk_Columha
0x1503	0x98	Columha		I've been cleaning up the wreckage	
				with some of the stronger men in	
				the village...
0x156a	0x98	Columha		...But this one won't budge at all.	
				It seems impossible to move with	
				human hands...	
0x15d0	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time, it seems	
				the only thing we can do is crush it	
				into smaller pieces with a hammer.	
0x1662	0x98	Columha		We've been working the last few days trying	
				to clean up the debris... But pushing this	
				one away is proving to be too difficult.	
0x16de	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time,	mp_0000c 0x15d0
				it seems like all we can do	
				is crush them with a hammer.	
talk_Ursaminor
0x17b9	0x98	Ursaminor		Though the world has become	
				like this, I'm glad to see my	
				sister.	
0x181c	0x98	Ursaminor		...If only she could make up with	
				Father, I'll be even happier.	
talk_Ursaminor_and_Reticul
0x188b	0x98	Ursaminor		Reticul, I'm glad you're safe...	
0x18d0	0x98	Ursaminor		I was really worried about you...	
0x1916	0x98	Reticul		Ursamina...	
				Yeah, I'm really sorry.	
0x195b	0x98	Reticul		I'll be here for a while helping	
				out with rebuilding the village,	
				so there's no need to worry.	
0x19cf	0x98	Ursaminor		...Will you make	
				up with Father?	
0x1a12	0x98	Reticul		Umm, well... You know, it'd be a little	
				awkward for us to meet each other...	
0x1a8a	0x98	Reticul		B-But maybe someday, okay?	
talk_Sculp
0x1c12	0x98	Sculp		Say Nayuta,	mp_0000 0x7935
				There's something I want you to hear.	
0x1c63	0x98	ALTO		Huh, me?	mp_0000 0x7988
				What could it possibly be?	
0x1ca5	0x98	Sculp		The truth is, recently I heard	mp_0000 0x7988mp_0000 
				a story from Antoria, but...	
0x1d00	0x98	Sculp		If I used more fertile "soil,"	mp_0000 0x7a23
				I'd definitely be able to	
				raise vegetables better.	
0x1d70	0x98	Sculp		Though using fertilizer is	mp_0000 0x7a7d
				fairly popular on the continent.	
0x1dcb	0x98	Sculp		However, I can't find very good	mp_0000 0x7adf
				soil on Remnant Island...	
				Nayuta, do you have any idea about this?	
0x1e4c	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh...?	mp_0000 0x7b57
				I'm afraid I don't have any idea.	
0x1ea7	0x98	ALTO		Originally, the soil on Remnant Island	mp_0000 0x7bb0
				everywhere is full of salt and hard...	
0x1f13	0x98	Sculp		As I thought...	mp_0000 0x7c18
				If you say it, then it must be true.	
0x1f67	0x98	Sculp		Ah, it seems I've asked the	mp_0000 0x7c75
				impossible of you.	
				Sorry, forget it.	
0x1fc6	0x98	Sculp		But if you get some good "soil"	mp_0000 0x7cd2
				somewhere, it'll be a help if	
				you give a little to me.	
0x203b	0x98	Sculp		Won't you keep that in mind	mp_0000 0x7d44
				for me?	
0x207e	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x20ab	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile "soil," was it...?	mp_0000 0x7db3
				 If I find some, shall I	
				 bring it to Sculp?)	
0x2253	0x98	Sculp		Hmm... It seems that we just might	 
				be able remove these stones now.	
0x22a6	0x98	Sculp		I can't believe there exists a human	
				who could move that by themselves.	
0x230d	0x98	Axe		Next is the one that fell near	
				your cow shed, I guess...	
0x2362	0x98	Axe		I'll meet you guys there as soon	
				as I'm finished with my patrol,	
0x240c	0x98	Sculp		Nayuta, don't worry about the	
				village. We'll protect the	
				place while you're gone.	
0x2492	0x98	Sculp		So you guys better make sure to	
				return safe and sound for us.	
0x2516	0x98	Sculp		A bunch of monsters we've never seen	
				before have been showing up lately.	
				We're telling everyone to be careful...	
0x2590	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, I'm glad Bootie's safe.	
0x25d0	0x98	Sculp		However... maybe the kids shouldn't	
				be let outside for a while.	
0x265b	0x98	Sculp		We can't take any chances with	
				these monsters popping up.	
0x26b4	0x98	Sculp		Though Orvus is out on patrol, the	
				kids should stay inside regardless.	
0x2749	0x98	Sculp		Oh... What to do? Of all places,	
				this stupid rock had to fall	
				from the sky and land here...	
0x27ac	0x98	Sculp		Well at least Jessica's safe, and	
				the barn can always be fixed.	
0x280c	0x98	Sculp		More importantly, I've got	
				to think about the village.	
0x28ab	0x98	Sculp		That's right, all my crops have	
				powered through this weather.	
0x290b	0x98	Sculp		It might be because of the	
				soil you brought me, Nayuta.	
0x2964	0x98	Sculp		...Many thanks, Nayuta!	
0x29c2	0x98	Sculp		Tending to the fields, taking care of	
				Jessica, and now removing the boulder	
				from the village square.	
0x2a54	0x98	Sculp		Man, there's a lot to do, but we	
				gotta keep it together here.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x2af2	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good "soil!?"	
0x2b46	0x98	Sculp		It is dark, has a soft feel and has a fragrant	mp_0000 0x97a3
				earthy scent... There's no mistake- It is	
				of excellent quality.	
0x2bd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, the truth is, I found it	mp_0000 0x9830
				someplace...	
0x2c1d	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's all right with you,	mp_0000 0x987a
				can I give it to you?	
0x2cab	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	mp_0000 0x9907
0x2ce0	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	mp_0000 0x993c
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x2d5b	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha of the general	mp_0000 0x99b7
				store came to tell me she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x2dd5	0x98	Sculp		Because she said she wants to stock	mp_0000 0x9a31
				my vegetables, I'm honored by the request	
				and I thought I would respond to it somehow.	
0x2e6e	0x98	Sculp		Anyhow, you helped me out, Nayuta.	mp_0000 0x9aca
				Please use this well for me.	
0x2ecd	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	mp_0000 0x9b29
0x2f0a	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	mp_0000 0x9b66
				I won't hesitate to tell you.	
0x2f62	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	mp_0000 0x9bbe
				I'll look forward to then, Nayuta.	
0x2ff1	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

0x3042	0x07	System	#4C	If you give "soil" to Sculp,	mp_0000 0x9c9e

0x3150	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0x31aa	0x98	Sculp		If it's all right with you, please give it here.	mp_0000 0x9e06
				I've again got some things I want to try	
				on the field.	
0x3230	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	mp_0000 0x9e8c
				If it is useful to you, Sculp.	
0x32a9	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this too is very fertile.	mp_0000 0x9f04
0x32e9	0x98	Sculp		Alright...Time to go try it.	mp_0000 0x9f44
0x3326	0x98	Sculp		I've got to quickly sell the vegetables	mp_0000 0x9f81
				I'm able to grow now.	
0x33b7	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

0x3442	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you again have	
				some good soil.	
0x349c	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's of unthinkably	mp_0000 0xa0f7
				fine quality. ...Hmm, just where	
				on Remnant Island did you get his...	
0x3521	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, various things happened.	mp_0000 0xa17c
0x355f	0x98	ALTO		Anyhow, I'm giving this to	mp_0000 0xa1ba
				you, Sculp.	
0x35d4	0x98	Sculp		Thank you as always.	mp_0000 0xa22e
				You're a great help.	
0x361d	0x98	Sculp		With just this good soil,	mp_0000 0xa277
				there's no mistake I can produce	
				even more vegetable varieties!	
0x3695	0x98	Sculp		Haha, as a farmer, I'm happy to	mp_0000 0xa2ef
				say that there's none better	
				than this.	
0x36fb	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these raised	mp_0000 0xa355
				vegetables to the general store. Nayuta,	
				I'm glad you found this for me.	
0x37bc	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

				looking at me like that...?	
				No way I'm staying home!	
0x3bfe	0x98	Bootie		It's times like this where a man has	
				to stand up for himself, isn't it?
0x3c56	0x98	Bootie		So, the Remnant Island patrol begins!	
0x3c9c	0x98	Dorado		I said go home!	
0x3cfb	0x98	Bootie		...I can do something too, you know.

				take great interest in you.	
0x3f40	0x98	Aquela		That is how it seems to me, boy.	mp_0000 0x7507

				This is thanks for that.	
0x40bc	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x40f0	0x98	Aquela		...It is passed down that	
				my clan made a grave error	
				in the distant past.	
0x4159	0x98	Aquela		It was said to have brought Calamity,	
				and sank the world into the sea...	
0x41c6	0x98	Aquela		So for generations, my clan has since watched	
				over this world from the shadows, passing down	
				this precautionary tale for future generations.	
0x4237	0x98	Aquela		Much lore has been lost over the years,

				 caused those wars in the past...?)	
0x43dd	0x98	NOI		(I-It's not impossible... Maybe.)

0x44a3	0x98	Aquela		I will not pry into the details,	
				but please, do your best.	
0x453f	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, I hope I did not surprise you	
				all of a sudden with this story.	
0x459c	0x98	Aquela		But the looks on your faces tell	
				me it was the right thing to do.	
0x45fe	0x98	Aquela		Though I am not sure of the specifics	
				of your mission... I feel it is	
				connected with our dearest wish.	
0x467f	0x98	Aquela		...Our wish to someday be forgiven	
				and redeemed of our mortal sin.	
0x4703	0x98	Aquela		Though I am not sure of the specifics

0x480b	0x98	Aquela		I can see... inside of your hearts,

0x486e	0x98	Aquela		A flimsy thread of hope that	
				is fragile and vulnerable, yet	
				necessary for moving forward.	
0x48f5	0x98	Aquela		Heh, what kind of future will it lead us to...?	
				We will have to watch it unfold for ourselves.	
0x4994	0x98	Aquela		I can see... inside of your hearts,

0x5003	0x98	Hydol		I see... I was thinking I	mp_0000 0x10fd
				had something to ask of

0x505b	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	mp_0000 0x1154
				All right, let's go there now.	
0x5124	0x98	Hydol		Though they were not particularly	
				injured, I examined Lyra and Vel	
				just to make sure.
0x5197	0x98	Hydol		The only reason they survived after	
				encountering such a powerful monster	
				is thanks to you, Nayuta.	
0x5206	0x98	Hydol		Please continue use your strength

0x528d	0x98	Hydol		There has been a rapid increase

0x5477	0x98	Reticul		We managed to get back, but

0x5519	0x98	Reticul		Hmm, it seems like you're still

0x5571	0x98	Reticul		Well, you'll survive. You just	
				need to rest a while longer.
0x55f9	0x98	Reticul		Making up with Papa... Hmm, I've	
				been thinking about it, but...	
0x566b	0x98	Reticul		For right now, I don't want to face

				can overcome anything.	
0x58c7	0x98	Axe		You've got to bring back the missing	
				Cygna, and your little Kureha back too...	
				and restore peace on Remnant Island.	
talk_Pyxia
0x5986	0x98	Pyxia		There's just something about the people	
				of this island that's admirable.	
0x59d9	0x98	Pyxia		Even at a time like this, they	
				stay positive and work together	
				to overcome hardship...	
0x5a48	0x98	Pyxia		I think I've finally managed	
				to decide what to paint.	
0x5ac3	0x98	Pyxia		I've finally managed to	mp_0000c 0x5a48
				decide what I want to paint.	
0x5b16	0x98	Pyxia		We, too, must work hard to	
				overcome this situation!	
0x5ba3	0x98	Pyxia		I can't believe that beautiful blue	
				sky and ocean would turn into this...	
0x5c01	0x98	Pyxia		It reminds me of that	
				famous artist's work,	
				"The End of Days"...	
0x5c69	0x98	Pyxia		...N-No way.	
0x5cc3	0x98	Pyxia		That beautiful blue sky and	
				ocean would turn into this...
0x5d23	0x98	Pyxia		Somehow, it doesn't feel real.
				It's a crazy feeling.	
talk_Horolo
0x5dda	0x98	Horolo		You. You look so awesome～!
0x5e24	0x98	Horolo		You look full of resolve	
				and determination...	
				I think it's super cool～!	
0x5e8d	0x98	Horolo		I'm not sure exactly	
				what's going on, but	
				I'm rooting for you～!	
0x5f17	0x98	Horolo		You. You have an amazingly	mp_0000c 0x5dda	
				good face for some reason.	
0x5f61	0x98	Horolo		I don't understand	mp_0000c 0x5e8d
				the situation well, but...	
				I'm rooting for you.	
0x5ff9	0x98	Horolo		It's like this whole world	
				has gone up in smoke～!	
0x6059	0x98	Horolo		At this rate, the art contest this	
				year will probably be canceled.	
0x60be	0x98	Horolo		I even came to Remnant Island and	
				found some good inspiration for it.	
				So disappointed～...	
0x6158	0x98	Horolo		With the world like this, the art contest	
				this year will probably be canceled.	
0x61cb	0x98	Horolo		I even came to Remnant Island and	mp_0000c 0x60be
				found some good inspiration for it.	
				So disappointing～...

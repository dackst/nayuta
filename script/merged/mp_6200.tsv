0x11dd	0x98	ALTO		As we thought, looks like	
				there ARE monsters here!	
0x122f	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x1257	0x98	Signa		We have to defeat them

0x12d3	0x98	Signa		All right, let's do this quickly!	
tutorial_stopper_cmb
0x13fd	0x98	ALTO		...Whoops, it would be a problem if

0x1601	0x07	System	#4C	When you continue to attack without taking damage,	
				[CHAIN] will accumulate in the lower-left of the screen.	
0x167b	0x07	System	#4C	When [CHAIN] reaches a certain amount,	
				extra bonuses such as increased attack

0x16f2	0x07	System	#4C	As long as your [CHAIN] continues,	
				the bonuses will remain in effect	
tutorial_collect
0x1adc	0x98	ALTO		Looks like rubble is blocking the way.	
				We can probably keep going if we	
				jump over it.	
0x1b64	0x98	Signa	#6A	Hmph...if it's rubble like this,	
				you should probably try clearing	
				it out with your sword.	
0x1bd4	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2

tutorial_jump
0x208d	0x98	Signa		What's this? It's completely

0x20dc	0x98	ALTO		Ah, what a waste. If it was better

0x2274	0x98	Signa		Well, let's just keep going.	
				It looks like all we can do	
				to proceed is jump.	
0x2310	0x07	System	#4C	During exploration, if you	
				press Ã— during a jump, you	
				perform a double-jump.	
0x236c	0x07	System	#4C	By using double-jumps,

0x2b2b	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x2b53	0x98	Signa		So, that device was to	
				deactivate the barrier	
				back there?	
0x2bb0	0x98	Signa		Haha, this is more	
				fun that I thought!	
0x2bfe	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2c23	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, nothing excites me

0x3af0	0x98	ALTO		Amazing...amazing, Cygna!

0x3e12	0x98	Signa	#6A	Haha, well that's okay.

0x3e93	0x98	Signa	#6A	By the look of it, much of

0x4572	0x98	ALTO		I have to search this

0x4f18	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ahaha, sorry. Looks like I haven't

0x4fbc	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Even so, you seem to have sharp

0x5043	0x98	Signa		"Sharpen your mind no matter

0x50c0	0x98	Signa		Enough of that.

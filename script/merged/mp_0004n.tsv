0xc4e	0x41	None	#0W#2E	Nayuta, having turned 16,	
				visited for his second summer vacation...#0E	
0xceb	0x41	None	#0W#2E	And when he came home

0xf51	0x98	Asa	#1W	Nayuta...Where are you?

0x12c2	0x06	Asa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x12eb	0x98	Asa	#6A	My, you're observing the stars.	
0x132c	0x98	Asa	#6A	Even if it's summer vacation,	
				it's not good to stay up late.	
0x13a9	0x98	ALTO		...It's been a year since then...	
				Terra has once again started	
				to come closer to the surface.	
0x1426	0x98	ALTO		Tonight, I think I see it even closer	
				than last night, maybe.	
0x148a	0x06	Asa		ANI_NOD	
0x14ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	...Oh...	
0x14e0	0x06	Asa		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1509	0x98	Asa	#6A	I almost can't believe	
				that it's been a year already.	
0x157f	0x98	ALTO		Yeah...	
				I don't feel that way at all.	
0x15cb	0x98	ALTO		...Cygna and Kureha too.	
				I hope they're doing fine.	
0x1625	0x06	Asa		ANI_LAUGH	
0x164b	0x98	Asa	#6A	...Huhu, I'm sure they are fine.	
				They are both very strong, see...	
0x16ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	I'm sure Noi is	
				watching over them.	
0x1712	0x98	ALTO	#0W	...Yeah, you're right.	
0x1753	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x1785	0x06	Asa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x17ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	Huhu, don't strain	
				yourself too much.	
0x17f4	0x98	Asa	#6A	If it interferes with your work	
				tomorrow, it'll be a problem, right?	
0x1879	0x98	ALTO		...Yeah, I know.	
				I'll go to bed soon.	
0x191d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x19d1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x1a17	0x98	ALTO		(...I observed Terra,	
				 and I wonder what I should do.)	
0x1a6e	0x98	ALTO		(The transfer gate stopped working...	
				 I've no way to see them.)	
0x1acd	0x98	ALTO		(Though I understand

0x1b99	0x98	ALTO		...Phew.	
0x1bc1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x1c05	0x98	ALTO		Cygna and the others would	
				laugh at something like this.	
0x1c64	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x1c89	0x98	ALTO		Since it's summer vacation,	
				I've got to make it worthwhile!

0x116b	0x98	Ophiuchus		Master Michey is in a state

0x11cb	0x98	Ophiuchus		Abnormalities have been going

0x1220	0x98	Ophiuchus		We must think of Master Michey,	
				who has an attachment to this island.	
0x12b1	0x98	Ophiuchus		...However, while I'm thinking this and that,	
				before I know it, he has moved, because	
				he's Master Michey.	
0x133d	0x98	Ophiuchus		Phew, I've got to take care	
				not to lose sight of him...	
0x13be	0x98	Ophiuchus		He comes and goes as he pleases.	
				I'm terribly sorry.	
0x1416	0x98	Ophiuchus		Though Master Michey was about	
				to leave on a walk...	
0x146e	0x98	Ophiuchus		Somehow, it seems he prefers places	
				where he can catch the eyes of	
				the people.	
0x1507	0x98	Ophiuchus		I'm terribly sorry that he comes	
				and goes as he pleases.	
0x1563	0x98	Ophiuchus		I'll be careful to ensure he

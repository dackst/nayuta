0x197d	0x98	NOI		I see...Certainly, this "Cage"

0x1a05	0x98	NOI		But somehow, the process

0x488c	0x98	Algorl	#0W	I do not care if it is simple. Tell me.

0x4c66	0x06	Algorl		ANI_NOD	
0x4c8d	0x98	Algorl		I see, that masked man...

0x4d24	0x98	Algorl	#0W	...I thought as much.	
0x4d66	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x4d8f	0x98	NOI	#6A	Algol...

0x4df9	0x98	Algorl		...As for his swordsmanship,

0x4e6b	0x98	Algorl		He used the gap in my defenses

0x504e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x5074	0x98	Algorl		He hated acts that run counter to moral principles,

0x5109	0x06	Algorl		ANI_DENY	
0x5131	0x98	Algorl		If he is the head of that race,

0x519a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x51c1	0x98	ALTO	#6A	If he is an imposter, then...	
				Or possibly, he is being manipulated...?	
0x5231	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Even so,

0x54a8	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x557b	0x98	ALTO	#6A	They said they will do it,

0x5719	0x98	Algorl		Anyway, hurry ahead you two,

0x579e	0x98	Algorl		A "power" for that purpose,

0xd54	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	...That's...our	world...	
0xda8	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Across the End of the World...	
				...is something like that...?	
0xe25	0x06	NOI		ANI_DENY	
0xe52	0x98	NOI	#1W#6A	...No way...	
0xe8b	0x98	Creha	#0W	...At the time, the Core of the	
				planet suffered terrible damage.	
0xef0	0x98	Creha	#0W	Even now, the planet's	
				destruction is still advancing.	
0xf44	0x98	Creha	#0W	The surface built by the humans
				up until now is only temporary...	
0xfb6	0x98	Creha	#0W	At this rate, before	
				long...absolute "death"	
				will envelop the surface.	
0x11f1	0x98	Creha	#1W	But we have the power to	
				restore this beautiful planet	
				back to its former state.	
0x12d1	0x98	Creha	#1W	...Even so...	
0x130a	0xBC	Creha		Ellipsis	
0x13b4	0x98	Creha	#1W	Even so, can you still say	
				what we're doing is wrong!?	
0x1437	0x98	Creha	#1W#16S	Answer me, Nayuta!	
0x1479	0x98	NOI	#1W#6A	...Master Kureha...

0x17a5	0x98	ALTO	#2W#6A	You are wrong.	
0x1905	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x192f	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	On the surface, people are	
				eagerly living out "history."	
0x1994	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Even though there's little land	
				left, and their lifespans are short,	
				people can take over various things...	
0x1a2b	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	The variety of literature and ruins	
				are proof of the accomplishments of	
				the surface world.	
0x1b81	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x1ba6	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	To us, that world is	
				absolutely not "temporary".	
0x1c02	0x98	NOI		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x1c7e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	When the god-like gaze of the	
				Mythos looks down on us, the	
				surface must seem tiny...	
0x1cfe	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Maybe its only natural you would	
				think of our world as "temporary".
0x1db0	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	But...	
0x1f61	0x98	ALTO	#0W#100x#270y	Even though it wasn't for very	
				long, you spent some time at	
				my house, Kureha.	
0x1ff6	0x98	ALTO	#0W#100x#270y	These past few years, Cygna has	
				worked the Handyman Shop with	
				me on Remnant Island.	
0x208d	0x98	ALTO	#1W#100x#270y	You two should understand	
				that already, right?	
0x210f	0x98	ALTO	#3W#100x#270y	That world is	
				truly irreplaceable.	
0x2218	0x98	Creha	#1W	..................!	
0x235d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x2395	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	People and Mythos	
				should live together!	
0x23f9	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	There must be another

0x2475	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Let's not give up until the

0x2626	0x98	Creha	#0W	If you say it, Nayuta...

0x3add	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Oh, that's right...	
				It went well...	
0x3b2d	0x06	Creha3		ANI_NOD	
0x3b74	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Yeah...Looks like we completely

0x3bd8	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Your world should

0x3c27	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT6	
0x3c95	0x98	Signa	#0W	Well, the case is closed.	
0x3d3f	0x98	Signa	#0W	Thanks to you,

0x3fc4	0x06	Creha3		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3ff8	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Thanks to the recoil earlier,	
				it's out of its orbit.	
0x4050	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Though we can control it with

0x40b4	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT5	
0x40f3	0x98	Signa	#0W	It'll be ahwile until it's

0x4402	0x98	Creha3	#0W	...Though I'm truly worried...	
0x4445	0x06	Creha3		ANI_DENY	
0x447b	0x98	Creha3	#2W	As I thought, we

0x44f5	0x98	ALTO	#2W#6A	...Ah...	mp_0001 0xd6a4
0x452b	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x4564	0x98	Signa	#1W	I think we need to fix the

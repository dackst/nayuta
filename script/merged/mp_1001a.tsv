0x1c0a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_LOOK_AROUND	
0x1c3f	0x98	ALTO		It's an amazing place this time too.	
0x1c8b	0x98	Signa		...It looks like a path along the tops	
				of large trees growing alongside	
				a wide river.	
0x1d39	0x98	Signa		It's a considerably more difficult	
				location than the animal trail from before.	
				Is there no proper road?

0x2084	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x20ae	0x98	ALTO		Thanks to that, we can	
				help you like this.	
0x20ff	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2127	0x98	Signa		Anyway, let's be careful of our footing	
				and proceed with caution.	
0x2188	0x98	Signa		But, we must hurry.	
				We've got to overtake	
				that Zext guy quickly.	
0x2206	0x98	Signa		Oh yeah...Nayuta,	
				are you thinking about	
				your stamina as you proceed?	
0x2281	0x98	Signa		If you're getting beat up by monsters,	
				you must temporarily retrace your	
				steps.	
0x22ef	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x231a	0x98	Signa		If you're really in trouble,

				lunch boxes from Eartha.	
0x238c	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x23b4	0x98	Signa		Eartha's home cooking.

				recover your energy.	
0x2422	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2447	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, that's right.	
				I've got to thank her later.	
0x2496	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x24c0	0x98	ALTO		And for the ones I've learned to make,	
				I should try gathering the ingredients 	
				and making them myself.	
0x254c	0x06	Signa		ANI_JOY	
0x2572	0x98	Signa		Ah, finally this feels like	
				a true adventure!	
0x25bf	0x98	Signa		...Coming to a place like this,	
				it's a natural thing, of course.	
0x2667	0x06	Signa		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x2696	0x98	Signa		I sense the monsters are

				What is happening to this world?	
0x2709	0x6B	NOI		Surprise	
0x273a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Could it be...that in your world,	
				there are no "Monsters"...?	
0x27c0	0x98	Signa		Well, no...They exist, but	
				I've never seen this many.	
0x281d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x2844	0x98	ALTO		There's kinds I've never seen before.	
				It's like a monster museum.	
0x28a4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x28ce	0x98	ALTO		...Oh yeah! Since I'm here,	
				I'll record them.

0x294d	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x29aa	0x98	Signa		Record...?	
0x29f4	0x98	ALTO		I brought my notebook	
				as a matter of fact.	
0x2a3d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x2a62	0x98	ALTO		If I record the monsters I

0x2c32	0x06	NOI		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x2c5b	0x98	NOI	#6A	Listen, let's quickly proceed ahead.

0x2d48	0x98	ALTO		Well then, let's begin

0x2e1c	0x07	System	#4C	Select [Enemy Info] under [System] in

				that monster just now?	
0x3d59	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT0	
0x3d81	0x98	Signa		It threw some strange attacks at us...	
0x3ded	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3e16	0x98	NOI		Umm...the truth is,	
				While I was protecting the <Master Gear>,	
				when I was running from Zext...	
0x3e90	0x98	NOI		The power of Arts (combat magic)	
				was stolen from me.	
0x3eea	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x3f1c	0x6B	Signa		Exclamation	
0x3f4f	0x98	NOI		Zext probably gave this

				order to hinder us...	
0x3fb7	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x3fdf	0x98	Signa		No, no, wait a sec.	
				I get the general idea	
				but...	
0x4037	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x4061	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Did you just say, "Magic?"	
0x40a9	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x4112	0x98	NOI		Y, yeah, I did but..	
				What's wrong all of a sudden?	
0x4162	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x418b	0x98	NOI		I used it a few times

0x42bb	0x98	ALTO	#6A	In our world, things like "Magic"	
				are the subject of fairly tales...	
0x433f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x4364	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Of course <Terra> would be

0x4678	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ahem, anyway...	
				If we defeat monsters that use magic,

0x4724	0x98	Signa		Thinking about fighting Zext and

0x4796	0x06	Signa		ANI_JOY

				start from 0, so be careful.

0xb5f	0x98	ALTO		(Now that you mention it...	
				 It's like the strange stone shard	
				 from before...)	
0xbcc	0x98	ALTO		Wasn't Ada knowledgable	
				about minerals and such?	
0xc18	0x98	ALTO		I found a strange, ore-like rock, you see...	
0xc68	0x98	Eida		Huh? A strange rock?	
0xc9c	0x98	Eida		Then, I'd better show it to the old man.	
				He knows even more about them than I do.	
0xde6	0x98	Eida		Oh yeah, Nayuta.	
				You've collected a lot of different things	
				while exploring the ruins, haven't you?	
0xe5c	0x98	Eida		But I wonder if you've ever found	
				anything like high-quality ore.	
0xec1	0x98	ALTO		Ore...?	
0xeee	0x98	Eida		Yeah, it seems like the price of the ore	
				used for making weapons has been rising lately.	
				We can't keep enough in stock.	
0xf86	0x98	Eida		If we had a little more ore,	
				our lineup could be even bigger.	
0xfe4	0x98	ALTO		(Ore, eh? If I find some,	
				 should I bring them to Ada?)

0x1279	0x98	Eida		Ore used for making weapons has increased in price.	
				If we had some more, our lineup could be bigger...	
talk_Eida_add
0x13e0	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta...	
				Isn't that some kind of ore?	
0x142d	0x98	Eida		Seems like it's pretty good quality.	
				That's great! Where did you find it?	
0x1495	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I picked it up somewhere...	
0x14d0	0x98	ALTO		Oh yeah! If it's alright with you,	
				how about I give it to you?	
0x1557	0x98	Eida		Is that really okay?	
				Thank you, you've been a big help.	
0x15b2	0x98	Eida		Haven't you been working hard lately?	
				I was thinking of expanding the	
				product lineup too.	
0x1629	0x98	Eida		If I had that mineral, I could ask the old man	
				to make some good weapons for me.	
				Don't hold back. Buy them!â˜†	
0x16b4	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...You're a	
				businessman as usual.	
0x16f9	0x98	ALTO		I'll be interested in them a little later.	
				Take care of me when that time comes,	
				Ada.	
0x17a0	0x07	System	#3C	New items have been added to	
				the weapon shop's lineup.	
0x17ec	0x07	System	#4C	If you give ore to Ada, you can	
				enhance the weapon shop's lineup.	
0x1842	0x07	System	#4C	If you find ore, bring	
				them to Ada.	
0x18d4	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta...	
				Looks like you've brought	
				me ore again.	
0x192c	0x98	Eida		Hand them over, if it's alright with you.	
				In return, I'll sell you some	
				cool weapons!	
0x199f	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, okay.	
				I'm looking forward to it.	
0x1a12	0x98	Eida		Thank you. I'll give these to	
				my old man to make armor for you.	
0x1a6f	0x98	Eida		They'll be on sale soon, so	
				please look forward to it!	
0x1af8	0x07	System	#3C	New items have been added to the

0x1b7f	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta...	mp_0111 0x18d4
				Looks like you've brought

0x1bd7	0x98	Eida		And what's more, it's a rare one.	
				...Where in the world did you get	
				this?
0x1c40	0x98	ALTO		Haha, that's a secret.	
0x1c76	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I'll be	
				giving it to you.	
0x1ce1	0x98	Eida		Wow, you're always such a big help.	
0x1d1f	0x98	Eida		With this much ore and the old man's arms,	
				our lineup will be the best in the world!	
0x1d8d	0x98	Eida		...Nayuta, welcome to the best weapon

				Haha, you came back for me.	
0x2356	0x98	NOI		Thanks...is what I want to say but,	
				I don't have any memories of you	
				from before...	
0x23c6	0x98	Eida		Those kinds of details	
				don't matter.	
0x2409	0x98	Eida		Hmm, my sense of smell	
				always knows about these	
				things.	
0x245e	0x98	Eida		I'm definitely prepared	
				for this!	
0x249e	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, you're certainly lively.	
0x2517	0x98	Eida		Noi returned...	
0x2546	0x98	Eida		Hmm, this smells like	
				an incident!	
0x2587	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x245e
0x25ef	0x98	Eida		Hmm, this smells like

0x2630	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x245e	
0x26a6	0x98	Eida		Good grief...	
				Nothing can be done with	
				free time lately.	
0x26fc	0x98	Eida		This past year, there have been	
				hardly any monster outbreaks, so	
				we haven't had any demand for weapons.	
0x2781	0x98	Eida		Once in a while customers come, requesting	
				kitchen knife repair or to fix Dorado's	
				blunt spear.	
0x2801	0x98	Eida		...Well, there's no mistake	
				that this is peace.	
0x2877	0x98	Eida		With unusual things in their place,	
				nothing can be done with free time.	
0x28dd	0x98	Eida		It's been really lonely	
				without Cygna, our	
				regular customer...	
0x296f	0x98	Eida		I heard from Orvus.	
				You guys...fought on	
				the broken moon.	
0x29c6	0x98	Eida		...No matter what happens,	
				we islanders share in it with you.	
0x2a22	0x98	Eida		I can't forget fighting	
				together with you guys.	
0x2a98	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x29c6	
0x2af4	0x98	Eida		Return if you're in pain.	
				We'll definitely support you.	
0x2b80	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta...	
				You've got a smile on your face.	
0x2bcd	0x98	Eida		Hehe, you've got to use	
				our shop's weapons.	
0x2c17	0x98	Eida		Now, if you need something,	
				please take a look.	
				We've gathered some nice weapons.	
0x2cae	0x98	Eida		Using our weapons will	
				put a smile on your face.	
0x2cfd	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x2c17		
0x2da2	0x98	Eida		I can't believe that kind of thing	
				appeared from the center of	
				the moon...	
0x2e0a	0x98	Eida		Since then, monsters have appeared	
				more frequently and the climate's been	
				thrown out of whack...	
0x2e88	0x98	Eida		And a strange being like	
				Noi appeared too. It's enough	
				to knock me off my feet.	
0x2ef6	0x98	NOI		I-I'm sorry...	
				I didn't mean to	
				threaten you.	
0x2f40	0x98	Eida		Hehe, somehow, I understand	
				that you're not a bad person.	
0x2f98	0x98	Eida		Anyway, as for that moon...	
				It might be some kind of	
				ominous sign.	
0x3020	0x98	Eida		I can't believe that kind of thing	
				appeared from the center of	
				the moon.	
0x3086	0x98	Eida		My old man took the initiative and	
				I'm helping him with the work, but...	
				It can't be helped that nothing's happened yet.	
0x3152	0x98	Eida		Kureha... She has a bit of a
				strange air about her, but	
				she is a kind and good person.	
0x31c2	0x98	Eida		All we can do is make	
				and sell weapons...	
0x320a	0x98	Eida		...Nayuta, take care of	
				that girl for me, okay?	
0x327e	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x31c2	
0x32c6	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x320a	
0x332e	0x98	Eida		Ooh, I'm cold somehow...	
				With this temperature,	
				maybe a storm is coming.	
0x3394	0x98	Eida		Maybe I'll light a little fire.	
				I'll get cold if this keeps up.	
0x342e	0x98	Eida		That Kureha girl is getting	
				used to this island little by little.	
0x3495	0x98	Eida		She looked happy and turned	
				the corner there a while ago.	
				...Yeah, she went to the cape.	
0x350a	0x98	ALTO		The cape, huh...?	
				Thanks Ada.	
0x3545	0x98	Eida		Hehe, by the way...	
				Out of Kureha and Lyra,	
				which one do you like more?	
0x35a2	0x98	Eida		You can tell me your secret, right?	
0x35d8	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3632	0x98	Eida		The air of Kureha is	
				different than us	
				island girls somehow.	
0x368c	0x98	Eida		It seems like she grew up	
				in a city somewhere, but	
				she's a good kid all the same.	
0x3717	0x98	Eida		If you're looking for Kureha,	
				she went out a little while ago.	
0x3776	0x98	Eida		That girl works pretty fast.	
				She finished sorting the	
				ledger really quickly.	
0x37e0	0x98	Eida		When I think about her kindness,	
				it doesn't match her appearance.	
				I wonder if she'll help again.	
0x3892	0x98	Eida		Haha, Nayuta,	
				are you worried about whether	
				this girl will get into trouble?	
0x38fc	0x98	Eida		It's all right.	
				As you'd expect, we can't let such	
				a skinny girl touch dangerous things.	
0x396a	0x98	Eida		In the beginning, she said she	
				wanted to wield weapons.	
0x39bd	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x39ef	0x98	ALTO		Sorry, Ada.	
				Kureha is a little	
				otherworldly.	
0x3a38	0x98	ALTO		If it's all right with you,	
				be careful as you watch over	
				her for me.	
0x3a98	0x98	Eida		Hehehe, leave it to me!	
0x3acf	0x98	ALTO		(She looks like she's enjoying herself...)	
0x3b41	0x98	Eida		Well, leave this girl to me.	
				At least I won't have her	
				do dangerous things.	
0x3baa	0x98	Eida		More than that...don't you have	
				to explain things to your sister?	
0x3c0a	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3c72	0x98	Eida		Nayuta...	
				Somehow, you seem more	
				reliable lately.	
0x3cc1	0x98	Eida		In the past you clung to Cygna,	
				were unsteady and unsure of yourself,	
				and wondered whether everything would be alright.	
0x3d56	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3d88	0x98	ALTO		S-So you thought	
				that, huh...	
0x3dc4	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, don't worry, don't worry.	
				At least I don't think that now.	
0x3e24	0x98	Eida		I only understand one thing	
				about you now...	
0x3e6f	0x98	Eida		If it's you now, you can surely achieve it.	
				Well, do your best.	
0x3ef5	0x98	Eida		I only understand one thing	mp_0111 0x3e24
				about you now...	
0x3f40	0x98	Eida		If it's you now, you can surely achieve it.	mp_0111 0x3e6f
				Well, do your best.	
0x3fd4	0x98	Eida		...Nayuta, you have a gloomy expression.	
0x401c	0x98	ALTO		Huh...	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x4042	0x98	Eida		It seems Eartha's collapsed.	
				I understand your feelings.	
0x4099	0x98	Eida		You don't have to look so down.	
				Even Eartha seems energetic.	
0x40f4	0x98	Eida		That's my feeling anyway...	
				It'll be alright. There is definitely hope.	
0x415a	0x98	Eida		If you understand, smile!!	
				I'll try to smile too!	
0x41aa	0x98	ALTO		Haha...	
				Thanks, Ada.	
0x41dd	0x98	Eida		That's fine!	
0x4231	0x98	Eida		It's alright, she'll get better soon.	
				I understand your sister's	
				feelings pretty wellâ˜†	
0x42a6	0x98	Eida		If you have such a gloomy face	
				then Eartha won't get better.	
				Though it hurts, you've got to smile!	
0x4362	0x98	Eida		Even so,	
				the peach of eternal youth...	
0x43a7	0x98	Eida		Hehe, I can't wait	
				to drink it!ãˆ±	
0x43e7	0x98	Eida		When it's finished, I'll give you some,	
				so look forward to it, OK?	
0x446c	0x98	Eida		Hey, Nayuta,	
				did something happen	
				to Cygna?	
0x44b5	0x98	ALTO		Huh...What do you mean?	
0x44ec	0x98	Eida		Y'see, he dropped by our shop	
				to buy a weapon, but...	
0x4540	0x98	Eida		Because he was pretty serious,	
				somehow, he didn't want to gossip.	
0x45a0	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that so...	mp_0101 0x51b9
0x45cf	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna...	
				 What the hell happened to you?)	
0x4640	0x98	Eida		Because Cygna was	
				pretty serious, somehow	
				he didn't want to gossip.	
0x46a1	0x98	Eida		Did something happen to him, I wonder?	
0x471f	0x98	Eida		Lately, it seems monsters	
				are appearing here and there	
				on the island.	
0x4782	0x98	Eida		The only people we have who can	
				fight them are you, Cygna and Master,	
				is that right?	
0x47f4	0x98	Eida		But when I compare you to the others,	
				you have a ways to go, maybe...	
0x4858	0x98	Eida		If push comes to shove,	
				buy a nice weapon.	
				There's no disadvantageâ˜†

0x49dd	0x98	Eida		Even though it seems Orvus'	
				story is important, I'll	
				return to work.	
0x4a3f	0x98	Eida		Well even so, this is the first time	
				I've seen a ruin this big.	
0x4a9d	0x98	Eida		...It seems that you've been	
				coming in here more often this year...	
				Nah, must be my imagination.	
0x4b43	0x98	Eida		...Oh, sorry, sorry.	
				If you need something,	
				please buy!	
0x4b98	0x98	Eida		We're a little disorderly now but,	
				we should have everything in	
				order soon.	
0x4c37	0x98	Eida		Hey there, Nayuta!	
0x4c69	0x98	Eida		Somehow, I heard lively	
				voices outside, but...	
				As expected, you've returned.	
0x4cd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, Ada.	
				Cygna's with me.	
0x4d0d	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, is that right.	
0x4d42	0x98	Eida		If we're talking about him,	
				he'll show his face soon.	
0x4d96	0x98	Eida		...But even so...	
0x4dc7	0x98	ALTO		U-umm...	
				Why are you staring like that?	
0x4e0d	0x98	Eida		Well you see, while you've been	
				away for a while you've gotten a	
				little more muscular.	
0x4e81	0x98	Eida		Hehehe...	
				It seems this will be	
				good for teasing Lyra.	
0x4ed5	0x98	ALTO		Umm...why did you put	
				Lyra into the conversation there?	
0x4f2b	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, don't worry about it.	
				I'm looking forward to	
				your sister's cookingâ˜†	
0x4f94	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x5000	0x98	Eida		Ever since you and Cygna came	
				to the island, I've had a lot of	
				free time.	
0x5067	0x98	Eida		The villagers would ask my old	
				man for help blacksmithing, but	
				never for any weapons.	
0x50da	0x98	Eida		Well, when you want to do something

talk_Columha
0x552e	0x98	Columha		Mm...Nayta,	
				You've collected four	
				"Zemuria Stones," huh...	
0x5589	0x98	Columha		Where in the world did you get so many...?	
				...No, it's fine, but...	
0x55ee	0x98	Columha		...Anyway, if you hand them over,	
				I can reforge the weapons and...	
0x569f	0x98	Columha		If I had four "Zemuria Stones," I	
				should be able to make unthinkably	
				strong weapons...	
0x5716	0x98	Columha		Nayuta, if you happen to come across some,	
				bring them to my place.	
				I'll make strong weapons for you.	
0x57cf	0x98	Columha		Haha, that the two of	
				you are here is most	
				fitting...	
0x5825	0x98	Columha		I don't know the details, but	
				I'll get fired up and strike this	
				sword with everything I've got.	
0x58a5	0x98	Columha		Use that and give

0x591c	0x98	Columha		I'll get fired up and strike this

0x597f	0x98	Columha		Use that and give	mp_0111 0x58a5
				it the form it should have.	
0x5a04	0x98	Columha		In Saint Cerize and the surrounding	
				countries, it is having a renaissance,	
				it seems.	
0x5a79	0x98	Columha		There were countries and town with hatred	
				in the past, but it seems they are now joining	
				hands.	
0x5af9	0x98	Columha		It seems that disputes and stupidity	
				haven't disappeared from this world	
				though...	
0x5b6c	0x98	Columha		When the renaissance is complete,	
				the world will be a little better of a	
				place.	
0x5c04	0x98	Columha		People are foolish animals...	
				Especially the dumb ones...	
0x5c5f	0x98	Columha		Now that the traces of those abnormalities	
				disappeared, I want it to be a little better	
				of a world. ...That is what I think.	
0x5d32	0x98	Columha		...Already, what we can	
				say to you means nothing.	
0x5d85	0x98	Columha		...Be careful, Nayuta.	
0x5dbe	0x98	Columha		And return safely...	
				That is all.

0x5f37	0x98	Columha		It's delayed due to abnormality,	
				and it's hard to get for free.	
				We're getting along somehow.	
0x5fb4	0x98	Columha		But, we plan to make your

				So rest easy.

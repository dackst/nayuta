0xb5f	0x98	ALTO		(Now that you mention it...	
				 I did find a strange
				 stone earlier...)	
0xbcc	0x98	ALTO		Ada, don't you know a lot	
				about minerals and stuff?	
0xc18	0x98	ALTO		You know, I found this strange	
				rock earlier, like an ore...	
0xc68	0x98	Eida		Huh? A strange rock...?	
0xc9c	0x98	Eida		Then I'd better show it to the old man.	
				He'd know more about this than I do.	
0xde6	0x98	Eida		Oh yeah, Nayuta, you've been	
				collecting all kinds of stuff	
				while exploring the ruins, right?	
0xe5c	0x98	Eida		I was wondering if you've ever found	
				anything like high-quality ore.	
0xec1	0x98	ALTO		Ore...?	
0xeee	0x98	Eida		Yeah, it seems like the price of the ore	
				for making weapons has been rising lately.	
				We can't keep enough in stock.	
0xf86	0x98	Eida		If we had a little more ore,	
				we could expand our lineup...	
0xfe4	0x98	ALTO		(Ore, eh? If I find some, maybe	
				 I should bring them to Ada.)

0x1279	0x98	Eida		The price of ore for making weapons is going up.	
				If we had some more, we could expand our lineup...	
talk_Eida_add
0x13e0	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta...	
				Isn't that a type of ore?	
0x142d	0x98	Eida		Looks like it's pretty good quality.	
				That's great! Where did you find it?	
0x1495	0x98	ALTO		I, uh, picked it up somewhere...	
0x14d0	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, you can take it if you want it.	
0x1557	0x98	Eida		Whoa, you sure? Thanks,	
				that'd be a huge help.	
0x15b2	0x98	Eida		Haven't you been on top of things lately?	
				We've been considering expanding our	
				product lineup, too～.	
0x1629	0x98	Eida		With this ore, I can ask the old	
				man to make me some better weapons.	
				Don't hold back, Nayuta. Buy them!☆	
0x16b4	0x98	ALTO		Haha... Always have	
				to make a sale.	
0x16f9	0x98	ALTO		But I might be a little interested.	
				I'll see you when they're ready, Ada.	
0x17a0	0x07	System	#3C	New items have been added to	
				the armory's lineup.	
0x17ec	0x07	System	#4C	If you give ore to Ada, you can	
				expand the armory's lineup.	
0x1842	0x07	System	#4C	Be sure to pick up ore	
				if you find any!	
0x18d4	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta... Looks like you've	
				brought me some ore again.	
0x192c	0x98	Eida		If you don't mind, let me have it.	
				In exchange, I'll sell you some	
				really cool weapons!	
0x199f	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, okay. That makes	
				both of us happy.	
0x1a12	0x98	Eida		Thank you～. I'll give these to	
				the old man to turn into armor.	
0x1a6f	0x98	Eida		It'll be on sale in a flash,	
				so please look forward to it!	
0x1af8	0x07	System	#3C	New items have been added to the	mp_0111 0x17a0

				Looks like you've brought	
				me ore again.	
0x1bd7	0x98	Eida		And it's a rare one too!	
				...Where did you even find this?
0x1c40	0x98	ALTO		Ha, that's a secret.	
0x1c76	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I'll be	
				giving this to you.	
0x1ce1	0x98	Eida		Wow～, we're always grateful for your help～!	
0x1d1f	0x98	Eida		With all this ore and my old man's skills,	
				our lineup will be the best in the world!	
0x1d8d	0x98	Eida		...Welcome to the world's greatest armory,

0x23c6	0x98	Eida		That kind of thing doesn't matter.	
0x2409	0x98	Eida		Hmm, I smell something

0x245e	0x98	Eida		Just make sure you get yourself fully

0x249e	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, you're in high spirits.	
0x2517	0x98	Eida		Noi's back...	
0x2546	0x98	Eida		Hmm, this smells like

0x26a6	0x98	Eida		Oh man... There's been	
				a bit of a slump lately.	
0x26fc	0x98	Eida		There have hardly been any monster outbreaks	
				this year, so there's no demand for weapons.	
0x2781	0x98	Eida		Sometimes we get a customer, but only for	
				kitchen knife repair or fixing Dorado's	
				bamboo spear.	
0x2801	0x98	Eida		...Well, peace is always	
				the number one thing, right?	
0x2877	0x98	Eida		It's been kinda boring since	
				the abnormalities stopped.	
0x28dd	0x98	Eida		I still miss our best	
				customer Cygna...	
0x296f	0x98	Eida		I heard from Orvus.	
				You guys...fought on	
				that shattered moon.	
0x29c6	0x98	Eida		...No matter what, we islanders	
				are all in this together.	
0x2a22	0x98	Eida		You can't forget:	
				we're on your side.	
0x2a98	0x98	Eida		No matter what, we islanders	
				are all in this together.	
0x2af4	0x98	Eida		Come back to us if things get tough.	
				We'll be there for you.	
0x2b80	0x98	Eida		Oh, Nayuta... You're looking good.	
0x2bcd	0x98	Eida		Hehe, just as anyone who	
				buys our weapons should.	
0x2c17	0x98	Eida		Now, why don't you take	
				a look at what we have?	
				We've got some nice weapons.	
0x2cae	0x98	Eida		Buying our weapons will	
				bring you happiness!	
0x2cfd	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x2c17		
0x2da2	0x98	Eida		I can't believe something like	
				that would pop out of a moon...	
0x2e0a	0x98	Eida		Since then, monsters have attacked	
				more frequently and the weather's	
				been acting even stranger...	
0x2e88	0x98	Eida		And some bizarre being like	
				Noi showed up too. It's enough	
				to knock me off my feet.	
0x2ef6	0x98	NOI		I-I'm sorry...	
				I didn't mean	
				to scare you.	
0x2f40	0x98	Eida		Hehe, I can tell that	
				you're not a bad person.	
0x2f98	0x98	Eida		Anyway, that moon...	
				It might be some kind	
				of foreboding sign.	
0x3020	0x98	Eida		I can't believe something like	
				that would pop out of a moon.	
0x3086	0x98	Eida		My old man has taken charge of assisting everyone...	
				But I can't help but feel that something else is	
				still going to happen...
0x3152	0x98	Eida		Kureha... She's a little strange,	
				but she's a good kid.	
0x31c2	0x98	Eida		All I'm good for is making	
				and selling weapons...	
0x320a	0x98	Eida		...Nayuta, look after	
				that girl for me, okay?	
0x327e	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x31c2	
0x32c6	0x98	Eida		mp_0111 0x320a	
0x332e	0x98	Eida		Ugh, I'm feeling a chill...	
				I wonder if a storm is coming.	
0x3394	0x98	Eida		Maybe I'll go hang around the fire.	
				I'm getting cold in this outfit.	
0x342e	0x98	Eida		That Kureha girl seems to be	
				getting adjusted to the island.	
0x3495	0x98	Eida		She was just happily walking by earlier.	
				...Ah, I think she went towards the cape.	
0x350a	0x98	ALTO		The cape, huh...?	
				Thanks, Ada.	
0x3545	0x98	Eida		Hmm, by the way...	
				Who do you prefer	
				more, Kureha or Lyra?	
0x35a2	0x98	Eida		You can trust me with	
				your secret, hmm?	
0x35d8	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3632	0x98	Eida		You know, Kureha is different from those	
				of us who grew up on the island somehow.	
0x368c	0x98	Eida		I guess she's a city girl, but	
				she's a good kid all the same.	
0x3717	0x98	Eida		If you're looking for Kureha,	
				she went out a little while ago.	
0x3776	0x98	Eida		She works fast. She finished sorting	
				the ledger faster than I could.	
0x37e0	0x98	Eida		I thought she'd be a little slow, but I	
				guess people aren't always as they seem.	
				I wonder if she'll come help me again.	
0x3892	0x98	Eida		Haha～, Nayuta, you worried that	
				she'll get herself hurt, are you?	
0x38fc	0x98	Eida		She'll be fine. Of course we	
				wouldn't let such a scrawny girl	
				do anything too dangerous.	
0x396a	0x98	Eida		Although at first, she said she	
				wanted to try hammering the swords.	
0x39bd	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x39ef	0x98	ALTO		Sorry, Ada. Kureha is	
				a little...unworldly.	
0x3a38	0x98	ALTO		It'd be great if you'd	
				watch over her for me.	
0x3a98	0x98	Eida		Hehehe, leave it to me! ♪	
0x3acf	0x98	ALTO		(Looks like she's enjoying this...)	
0x3b41	0x98	Eida		Well, just let me take care of this girl.	
				I won't let her do anything dangerous, at least.	
0x3baa	0x98	Eida		More importantly... You'll have to explain	
				yourself to your darling Ada later, okay?	
0x3c0a	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3c72	0x98	Eida		Nayuta... You seem to have	
				become more reliable lately.	
0x3cc1	0x98	Eida		You used to always be clinging to Cygna,	
				wandering around and unsure of yourself.	
				I wondered if you were doing all right.	
0x3d56	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3d88	0x98	ALTO		S-So that's what you	
				think of me...?	
0x3dc4	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, don't worry, don't worry.	
				At least, I don't think that now.	
0x3e24	0x98	Eida		All I know for sure is that you're	
				planning to do something right now...	
0x3e6f	0x98	Eida		And you can do it.	
				I know you can.	
				Well, good luck.	
0x3ef5	0x98	Eida		I only understand one thing	mp_0111 0x3e24

0x3f40	0x98	Eida		If it's you now, you can surely achieve it.	mp_0111 0x3e6f

0x3fd4	0x98	Eida		...You look a little depressed, Nayuta.	
0x401c	0x98	ALTO		Huh...	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x4042	0x98	Eida		I heard Eartha fell ill.

0x4099	0x98	Eida		You don't have to be so down.	
				Even Eartha looks to be doing	
				better than you.	
0x40f4	0x98	Eida		That's my feeling anyway...	
				It's okay, there's always hope.	
0x415a	0x98	Eida		Okay? Smile when you see me!!	
				Try to smile with everyone!	
0x41aa	0x98	ALTO		Haha... Thanks, Ada.	
0x41dd	0x98	Eida		There it is!	
0x4231	0x98	Eida		Don't worry, she'll get better soon.	
				My lady's intuition is very strong. ☆	
0x42a6	0x98	Eida		If you keep looking so down all the
				time, Eartha can't feel any better.	
				You've got to smile, even if it hurts!	
0x4362	0x98	Eida		Still, a peach of eternal youth...	
0x43a7	0x98	Eida		Hehe, I can't wait	
				to drink it～! ㈱	
0x43e7	0x98	Eida		I'll share some with you when it's done,	
				so you'll have to wait and see, okay?	
0x446c	0x98	Eida		Hey, Nayuta, did	
				something happen	
				to Cygna?	
0x44b5	0x98	ALTO		Huh...? What do you mean?	
0x44ec	0x98	Eida		I dunno, he just dropped by to	
				shop for some weapons, but...	
0x4540	0x98	Eida		He looked so serious, it was	
				hard to make conversation.	
0x45a0	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that so...	mp_0101 0x51b9
0x45cf	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna...	
				 What the hell happened?)	
0x4640	0x98	Eida		Cygna looked so serious, it	
				was hard to make conversation.	
0x46a1	0x98	Eida		Did something happen, I wonder?	
0x471f	0x98	Eida		Lately, it seems monsters	
				have been popping up more	
				frequently on the island.	
0x4782	0x98	Eida		The only people we have on the	
				island who can fight them are you,	
				Cygna and your Master, right?	
0x47f4	0x98	Eida		Well, maybe you're not quite	
				as skilled as the other two...
0x4858	0x98	Eida		But for when push comes to shove,	
				you should still buy a nice weapon! ☆	
0x48e2	0x98	Eida		Lately, it seems monsters	mp_0111 0x471f

				There's no disadvantage☆	
0x49dd	0x98	Eida		According to Orvus, it didn't look	
				like it was going to be a big deal,	
				so I decided to get back to work.
0x4a3f	0x98	Eida		But even so, this is the first	
				time I've seen ruins this big.	
0x4a9d	0x98	Eida		...It seems like they've been	
				falling more often this year...	
				Nah, must be my imagination.	
0x4b43	0x98	Eida		...Oh, sorry, sorry.	
				Please buy something	
				if you need it!	
0x4b98	0x98	Eida		There's a bit of a mess, but	
				we should have everything 	
				cleaned up soon.
0x4c37	0x98	Eida		Wassup, Nayuta!	
0x4c69	0x98	Eida		I hear a lot of commotion outside.

0x4cd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, Ada. Cygna's also back.	
0x4d0d	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, is that right?	
0x4d42	0x98	Eida		Knowing him, he'll be coming

0x4d96	0x98	Eida		Hmm, and yet...	
0x4dc7	0x98	ALTO		Umm... Uh, why are you	
				looking at me like that?	
0x4e0d	0x98	Eida		Well, I just think you've gotten more	
				muscular since you've been gone.	
0x4e81	0x98	Eida		Hehehe... That was definitely	
				worth facing Lyra's chagrin.	
0x4ed5	0x98	ALTO		Umm... Why did you	
				mention Lyra just now?		
0x4f2b	0x98	Eida		Ahaha, it's nothing, it's nothing.	
				Ada here is just having a little fun! ☆	
0x4f94	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x5000	0x98	Eida		It's been boring ever since you	
				and Cygna left for the city.	
0x5067	0x98	Eida		Most villagers only ask my old	
				man for blacksmithing help, so	
				I can never sell any weapons～!	
0x50da	0x98	Eida		Well, come on by if you run out of things	
				to do during your summer vacation and	
				feel like playing with swords.	
0x515c	0x98	Eida		I'll help pick out a cool

talk_Columha

0x5589	0x98	Columha		How did you even find that much...?	
				...No, it's not a problem, but...	
0x55ee	0x98	Columha		...Anyway, give them to me, and	
				I can forge them into weapons...	
0x569f	0x98	Columha		With four pieces of Zemurian Ore,

0x5716	0x98	Columha		Nayuta, if you happen to come	
				across any, bring them here.	
				I'll make you the perfect weapon.	
0x57cf	0x98	Columha		Hmm, the two of you look pretty	
				comfortable together...	
0x5825	0x98	Columha		I don't know the exact circumstances, but	
				I have to get fired up and ready this

0x58a5	0x98	Columha		Please, use it to do	
				what you need to do. 
0x591c	0x98	Columha		I have to get fired up and ready this	
				sword with everything I've got.
0x597f	0x98	Columha		Use that and give	mp_0111 0x58a5
				it the form it should have.	
0x5a04	0x98	Columha		The city of Saint Cerise and the	
				countries of the continent are	
				slowly rebuilding, it seems.	
0x5a79	0x98	Columha		Cities and countries that would only	
				bicker with each other in the past	
				seem to be joining hands now.	
0x5af9	0x98	Columha		It's not like stupid disputes	
				have completely disappeared	
				from this world though...	
0x5b6c	0x98	Columha		Once the reconstruction is complete,	
				I can only hope the world will remain	
				a better place.	
0x5c04	0x98	Columha		People are foolish little creatures...	
				They didn't get any wiser all of a sudden...	
0x5c5f	0x98	Columha		I can only hope the world will remain a better place	
				once it recovers from the aftermath of the abnormalities.
				...That's what I believe, anyway.
0x5d32	0x98	Columha		...There's nothing more	
				for us to say to you.	
0x5d85	0x98	Columha		...Be careful, Nayuta.	
0x5dbe	0x98	Columha		And come back safe...	
				That is all.	
0x5e29	0x98	Columha		...Be careful, Nayuta.	mp_0111 0x5d85
0x5e62	0x98	Columha		And return safely...	
0x5ecf	0x98	Columha		I'm making hammers for everyone	
				working on removing the rubble...	
0x5f37	0x98	Columha		Due to the abnormalities, distribution has	
				slowed and it's hard to get materials...	
				But we'll make do somehow.	
0x5fb4	0x98	Columha		However, I plan to make manufacturing	
				your weapons our top priority...	
				So don't worry about that.	
0x6040	0x98	Columha		It's delayed due to abnormality,	mp_0111 0x5f37
				and it's hard to get for free.	
				We're getting along somehow.	
0x60bd	0x98	Columha		But, we plan to make your	mp_0111 0x5fb4
				weapons our top priority...	
				So rest easy.	
0x6157	0x98	Columha		Those empty suits of armor seem to all	
				have been controlled by that Zext.	
0x61b0	0x98	Columha		Unfortunately, with that kind of power,	
				he might have the strength to oppose an	
				entire army single-handedly...	
0x621d	0x98	Columha		Nayuta, take care of yourself...	
0x6287	0x98	Columha		Zext is no ordinary man...	
0x62d3	0x98	Columha		Nayuta, be careful...	
0x633a	0x98	Columha		It sure is noisy outside...	
				Did something happen?

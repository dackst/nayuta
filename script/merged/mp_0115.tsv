0xdd2	0x98	Volans		Noi...	
				Could it be that you've	
				returned to me!?	
0xe21	0x98	Volans		How about it, this time for sure,	
				will you allow me to experiment	
				on you?	
0xe8a	0x98	NOI		A-Allow me to pass on that.	
0xec4	0x98	ALTO		(That's as always...)	
0xf21	0x98	Volans		Hehe, it has been a while	
				since I met a fellow baron...	
				You have a better face than before.	
0xf9b	0x98	Volans		Everyone got through the	
				abnormalities, and I expect	
				the future will be strange too.	
0x1045	0x98	Volans		Everyone got through the abnormalities,	
				and together with light, the storm over	
				"The End of the World" cleared up.	
0x10d7	0x98	Volans		And, after that, I saw the	
				"continuation of the world"...	
0x1131	0x98	Volans		Though it's been a year since then,	
				researchers everywhere are still busy.	
0x119c	0x98	Volans		I, too, am troubled by all the	
				help requests I'm getting.	
0x11f6	0x98	ALTO		Yeah...Well, it can't be helped.	
				The common sense about the	
				world was overturned, after all.	
0x1270	0x98	ALTO		From here on, I wonder what will	
				happen to the Ciencia Sea...	
				and our world.	
0x12da	0x98	Volans		Now then...	
				No matter how much I research,	
				I cannot measure the future.	
0x1341	0x98	Volans		I am sure that is for	
				the young to decide.	
0x138c	0x98	ALTO		...That's right.	mp_0100 0x17f91
0x13f6	0x98	Volans		The storm at "The End of the World" cleared	
				up, and I can see the world continuing...	
				Our common sense is overturned.	
0x148b	0x98	Volans		The future of this sea is for you	
				young ones to decide.	
0x14e3	0x98	Volans		Huhu, of course I am an existence	
				that is still researching.	
				I do not intend to lose to the young.	
0x158d	0x98	Volans		The future of this sea is for you	mp_0115 0x148b
				young ones to decide.	
0x15e5	0x98	Volans		Huhu, of course I am an existence	
				that is still researching.

0x1757	0x98	Volans		...Thanks to you, I've come	
				to understand various things.	
				Please accept my thanks.	
0x17c9	0x98	Volans		Now, I'm sure much time is needed	
				to correct the errors of "Humans"...	
0x1830	0x98	Volans		Regarding to the tablet memos,	
				Leave them with me. Please	
				ask me when you want to read them.	
0x1951	0x98	Volans		The world has fallen into the height	
				of chaos, and the countries of the	
				Empire continent are fighting a war.	
0x19dd	0x98	Volans		However on the contrary, if I think about it,	
				with only this chaos, somehow	
				we should be able to stop the fighting.	
0x1a70	0x98	Volans		...If I assemble the truth of these abnormalities	
				and use the Baron's connections, it should	
				be possible.	
0x1af9	0x98	Volans		Huhu, we must exhaust our	
				full power.	
0x1b67	0x98	Volans		...If I assemble the truth of these abnormalities	
				and use the baron's connections, we should be	
				able to put an end to the chaos.	
0x1c07	0x98	Volans		Huhu, I wonder how much my	
				thesis will be praised.	
				I will exhaust my full power.	
0x1caf	0x98	Volans		The place you are heading for now...	
				I am sure it holds all the answers.	
0x1d18	0x98	Volans		As a researcher, it is regrettable	
				that I cannot go with you...	
0x1d78	0x98	Volans		I am looking forward to your	
				safe return and hearing your	
				stories.	
0x1e02	0x98	Volans		As a researcher, it is regrettable	mp_0115 0x1d18
				that I cannot go with you...	
0x1e62	0x98	Volans		I am looking forward to your	mp_0115 0x1d78
				safe return and hearing your	
				stories.	
0x1efa	0x98	Volans		Though I received the explanation of that other world	
				we call the moon from start to finish from Noi...	
0x1f81	0x98	Volans		In reality, had I not seen	
				Noi's appearance with these eyes,	
				I never would have believed it.	
0x1ffd	0x98	Volans		It is the feeling of my common sense	
				being crushed.	
				Ah, what a good feeling...	
0x206b	0x98	Volans		...Oh, I'm sorry.	
				I unintentionally got	
				carried away.	
0x20e8	0x98	Volans		Anyhow, I am about to continue my	
				research to break the deadlock in	
				this situation.	
0x215b	0x98	Volans		If you know something,	
				please tell me.	
0x21d8	0x98	Volans		I cannot believe that a man who possesses	
				power beyond human understanding exists...	
0x224d	0x98	Volans		It is a little too far removed from	
				reality for me to believe my eyes.	
0x22b4	0x98	Volans		...Anyway, we too	
				will do what we can.	
0x22fb	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, please do your best.	
0x2360	0x98	Volans		I cannot believe that a man who possesses	mp_0115 0x21d8
				power beyond human understanding exists...	
0x23d5	0x98	Volans		...Anyway, we too	
				will do what we can.	
				Please do your best, Nayuta.	
0x246e	0x98	Volans		Hmm, it is cold for some reason.	
				It is like snow in my home	
				country, the Empire.	
0x24de	0x98	Volans		I am from the northern part of the Empire.	
				This degree of cold is not unusual there.	
				Of course, I will think of a way to deal with this.	
0x2587	0x98	Volans		Ha ha ha, if you are cold,	
				dress warmly, Nayuta.	
0x2600	0x98	Volans		I am from the northern part of the Empire.	mp_0115 0x24de	
				This degree of cold is not unusual there.	
				Of course, I will think of a way to deal with this.	
0x26a9	0x98	Volans		If you are cold, dress warmly, Nayuta.	
0x2727	0x98	Volans		In the Ciencia Sea, sometimes ruin	
				fragments fall from the sky...	
0x278a	0x98	Volans		Two ruins have never	
				fallen on the same spot.	
0x27e0	0x98	Volans		Comparing outcome, those	
				two are a perfect coincidence.	
0x2838	0x98	ALTO		Huh, in other words...?	
0x286f	0x98	Volans		Huhu, I must think that the same ruin	
				split and fell in different places.	
0x28d9	0x98	Volans		However, the two drop locations are	
				the north part and southern tip of	
				the Ciencia Sea.	
0x2950	0x98	Volans		According to one theory, the ruins were	
				destroyed by a disaster once, and they	
				are ancient...	
0x29cd	0x98	Volans		Even so, it can't be explained.	
				...I want to uncover that mystery	
				with these hands somehow.	
0x2a82	0x98	Volans		As for the ruins that fall from the sky,	
				according to one theory, they were destroyed	
				in an ancient disaster.	
0x2b0f	0x98	Volans		Even so, they cannot be explained.	
0x2b53	0x98	Volans		But, if I am on this "Remnant Island" where	
				ruins fall and pile up, there may be some	
				clue to unraveling this mystery...	
0x2beb	0x98	Volans		Huhu, that is what I think.	
0x2c50	0x98	Volans		Regarding to the falling ruins phenomenon,	
				even the scientific community is in a state	
				of disarray.	
0x2cd8	0x98	Volans		Huhu, if possible, I want to unravel the	
				truth with my own hands.	
0x2d70	0x98	Volans		...There is no higher joy than hearing	
				that your sister has been cured...	
0x2dda	0x98	Volans		That medicinal herb was supposed to be extinct.	
				On a remote island like this one, you should	
				not have been able to obtain some in a short time.	
0x2e82	0x98	Volans		If we assume that it is possible...	
				Star Shards, this island's signature product,	
				the brilliant world reflected in them...	
0x2f1c	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, could it be...	
				If you have some connection	
				to Lost Heaven...	
0x2f89	0x6B	Volans		Ellipsis	
0x2fbd	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x2fef	0x98	ALTO		U-Umm, you see...	mp_0110 0x11d08
0x3020	0x98	Volans		...Huhu, well, that is fine.	
				If it happens to exist,	
				I will know eventually.	
0x308b	0x98	Volans		Maybe you can become the	
				ultimate subject of my research.	
0x30e1	0x98	Volans		Muhuhu...Wahahahaha!	
0x3119	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x314b	0x98	ALTO		(Hmm, somehow it looks like one of	
				 his buttons was pressed...)	
0x31c9	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, could it be...	
				From that Lost Heaven...	
0x3224	0x98	Volans		Maybe you can become the	mp_0115 0x308b
				ultimate subject of my research.	
0x327a	0x98	Volans		Muhuhu...Wahahahaha!	mp_0115 0x30e1
0x32e8	0x98	Volans		The medicinal herb known	
				as Yupina Grass is	
				already extinct.	
0x334b	0x98	Volans		...In other words,	
				it would be impossible to
				find any more of it today.
0x33c8	0x98	Volans		Though it seems cruel...	
				Do not lose heart too much.	
0x3445	0x98	Volans		The medicinal herb known	mp_0115 0x32e8
				as Yupina Grass is	
				already extinct.	
0x34a8	0x98	Volans		Unless if a miracle were to happen...	
				It is impossible to obtain any.	
0x3594	0x98	Volans		Hehe, the baron's head	
				is a little hard.	
0x35dd	0x98	Volans		Even though we have taken the	
				first step in researching the	
				strained environment.	
0x364e	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, you think so too,	
				don't you?	
0x3693	0x98	ALTO		(I feel like it depends on the situation...)	
0x3707	0x98	Volans		By opening this museum,	
				it will further my research.	
0x375c	0x98	Volans		We researchers must	
				research the strained	
				environment much more!	
0x37f2	0x98	Volans		By the way, Nayuta.	
				your family's name	
				is "Herschel"...	
0x3847	0x98	Volans		Surely, your father was	
				an astronomer, was he not?	
0x389a	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x38cc	0x98	ALTO		Yes, that's true, but...	
				Do you mean you knew my father!?	
0x3924	0x98	Volans		Only his name.	
0x3954	0x98	Volans		Certainly, he was the one who first	
				introduced End of the World and	
				Lost Heaven related research.	
0x39d7	0x98	Volans		His hypothesis stated that there	
				exists another world, Lost Heaven,	
				on the other side of the End.	
0x3a4c	0x98	Volans		My specialty is ruins and natural history,	
				and his field was a little different...	
				His papers were very interesting when I read them.	
0x3aed	0x98	ALTO		mp_0001 0xcecd
0x3b1a	0x98	ALTO		But, I thought that hypothesis had not been	
				widely accepted by the scientific community...	
0x3b97	0x98	Volans		Huhu, scientific	
				progress continues.	
0x3bdc	0x98	Volans		Though there are thousands of conflicting	
				hypotheses and proposals explaining how this 	
				world works, it will be settled someday.	
0x3c77	0x98	Volans		You believe this as well, do you not?	
0x3cbb	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x3ced	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yes!	mp_0002 0xd4f0
0x3d13	0x98	ALTO		(One day, definitely, I will...)	
0x3d53	0x98	Volans		Hahaha...! It seems you	
				are a natural scientist.	
0x3ddf	0x98	Volans		My objective is to identify the	
				true nature of the ruins that fall into the	
				Ciencia Sea and Remnant Island.	
0x3e68	0x98	Volans		Lost Heaven and the End of the World	
				are also of interest to science.	
0x3ed6	0x98	Volans		The End of the World is thought	
				to be real, but it has not been	
				directly confirmed .	
0x3f50	0x98	Volans		At the End of the World, there is	
				thought to be a raging black storm...	
				beyond which there is nothing...	
0x3fdd	0x98	Volans		Huhu, we are building new knowledge	
				of this world along with young	
				people like you.	
0x406f	0x98	Volans		...Huhu, to meet someone I could	
				discuss things like this with	
				this island!	
0x40df	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, you are an interesting young man.	
				Once again, I look forward to working with	
				you from here on.

0x7583	0x98	Caelum		This time, Coron has announced

0x7607	0x98	Caelum		The fruit of her investigations during the

0x775a	0x98	Caelum		He plans to assemble them all into a book.	
				He will send a copy to every town and country

0x7801	0x98	Caelum		With this, the chaos everywhere will

				It's been a while!	
0x7c37	0x98	Caelum		During this time, unbelievable things

0x7ca2	0x98	Caelum		The people of this island are	
				doing their best with whatever	
				they can every day, it seems.	
0x7d1c	0x98	Caelum		They are strong.	
				We should learn from their example!	
0x7d97	0x98	Caelum		Some time ago, though we didn't	
				ask for them, fish and vegetables	
				were brought here.	
0x7e09	0x98	Caelum		Somehow, this is a good island.	
				I'm glad I came to this island.	
0x7e9f	0x98	Caelum		That monster of an old man	
				attacked the island...	
0x7ef6	0x98	Caelum		And what's more, I can't believe

0x7f5a	0x98	Caelum		...Don't lose heart, Nayuta.	
				I'm sure we'll do something.

0x80b1	0x98	Caelum		Hmm...it's chilly somehow...	
0x80ee	0x98	Caelum		That's why I changed my clothes just now.

0x8755	0x98	Caelum		...Nayuta, hang in there.	
				I'm sure there is hope.	
0x87a7	0x98	Caelum		She is a good person like you,

0x88f9	0x98	Caelum		My, I wonder what you

0x8945	0x98	Caelum		Since he's right there,	
				why not speak with him?	
0x89c9	0x98	Caelum		It seems the Imperial	
				Baron Victor has arrived.	
0x8a19	0x98	Caelum		We have been Dr. Volans'	
				inspectors since the time	
				we were in the Empire.	
0x8a82	0x98	Caelum		...What an unfortunate	
				duty we have.	
0x8aef	0x98	Caelum		Back in the Empire, the Baron	
				helped out Dr. Volans.	
0x8b4b	0x98	Caelum		Huhu, since then,	
				the two of them have	
				become close.	
0x8bf4	0x98	Caelum		Hmm, as expected, Dr. Volans'	
				decision to bring him along	
				was correct.	
0x8c5a	0x98	Caelum		Since I came to this remote	
				place, I was able to meet	
				a cute boy like you, Nayuta! ㈱	
0x8ccd	0x98	Caelum		Truly, we have two more	
				researcher members, but	
				Vavo won't come out...	
0x8d33	0x98	Caelum		Coron is very shy～.	
0x8d69	0x98	Caelum		...She is my younger twin.	
				She is in no way a late bloomer.	
0x8dff	0x98	Caelum		We haven't gathered exhibit goods.	
				Now, almost all the exhibit rooms	
				are closed.	
0x8e6f	0x98	Caelum		Once we've assembled some goods

0x8ef3	0x98	Caelum		Huhu, this is your time

0x8f67	0x98	Caelum		I'll introduce our members

0x90aa	0x98	Caelum		Hmm, as expected, Dr. Volans bringing

talk_Caelum_and_Coron
0x9343	0x98	Caelum		Coron, you should dress	
				more fashionably, don't	
				you think?	
0x939d	0x98	Caelum		Consider your clothing a little more.	
				You'll embarrass the scientific	
				community.	
0x940d	0x98	Coron		O-Ooh...	
				You're certainly right, but...	
0x9454	0x98	Coron		As expected, if I had the same	
				look as you, I'd be too	
				embarrassed...

0x9594	0x98	Coron		Though I'm happy to publish my	
				thesis...	
0x95dc	0x98	Coron		As you'd expect, I have to	
				get out Caelum's appearance～...	
0x966d	0x98	Coron		By Dr. Volans' proposal,	
				I have been researching the details of the	
				movement of marine life around the island.	
0x96fa	0x98	Coron		From the instincts of wild animals,	
				we can identify locations that are	
				safe even if a great disaster occurs...	
0x9787	0x98	Coron		As expected from Dr. Volans...	
				I was looking in the wrong place.	
0x980f	0x98	Coron		mp_0115 0x966d
0x989c	0x98	Coron		If it goes well, we will know locations to	
				which we can run in case of disaster.	
				I've got to do my best...	
0x995b	0x98	Coron		Kureha was kidnapped, even though	
				the attack itself is over...	
0x99b9	0x98	Coron		Is it okay to continue	
				research on this island	
				in this situation?	
0x9a24	0x98	Coron		I want to go back home	
				in the Empire somehow...	
0x9aa9	0x98	Coron		Kureha was kidnapped,	
				and we don't know anything
				about the culprit...	
0x9aff	0x98	Coron		Is it okay to continue	
				research on this island	
				in this situation...?	
talk_Vavo
0x9bb4	0x98	Vavo		Dr. Volans' ideas are	
				surprising, as you'd expect.	
0x9c05	0x98	Vavo		However...at the same time,	
				I feel somehow that these	
				abnormalities cannot be helped.	
0x9c78	0x98	Vavo		No matter where we run we cannot run...	
				Thinking that cannot be helped.	
0x9d06	0x98	Vavo		I feel somehow that these	
				abnormalities cannot be helped.	
0x9d5e	0x98	Vavo		No matter where we run we cannot run...	
				Somehow, thinking that cannot be helped.	
0x9e03	0x98	Vavo		During the attack, this museum	
				became an emergency shelter.	
0x9e5d	0x98	Vavo		We guided the islanders along with the doctor,	
				and we were able to shelter most of them.	
0x9ecd	0x98	Vavo		In the end, that Zext guy	
				was interested only in	
				Kureha, wasn't he...?	
0x9f54	0x98	Vavo		In the end, that Zext guy	mp_0115 0x9ecd
				was interested only in	
				Kureha, wasn't he...?	
0x9fb3	0x98	Vavo		That we couldn't protect her...	
				As a man, I'm ashamed.	
talk_Victor

0xa0ac	0x98	Victor		Even so, it's been a year since	
				those abnormalities...	
				The time it takes to blink your eye.	
0xa127	0x98	Victor		The restoration is proceeding and	
				the situation in the Empire has	
				calmed down considerably.	
0xa1a2	0x98	Victor		The day we can say true peace

0xa29a	0x98	Victor		The day we can say true peace	mp_0115 0xa1a2

0xa397	0x98	Victor		The nobles of the Empire are heavily	
				invested in Dr. Volans'	research...	
0xa3f0	0x98	Victor		I have come here myself on orders from my	
				prince to inspect the fruits of his research...	
				Alas, Dr. Volans is an eccentric.	
0xa482	0x98	Victor		All I can do is let him do what he likes.
				Hopefully this will not	disadvantage 	
				my mother country.	
talk_Victor_and_Volans
0xa512	0x98	Victor		I came all they way here from the

				the research on Remnant Island...	
0xa589	0x98	Victor		Dr. Volans...just what are	
				you doing with this museum?	
0xa5df	0x98	Victor		How can you possibly contribute to the future of our mother
				Are you saying doing something	
				like this will contribute to the future	
				of our mother country?	
0xa65c	0x98	Volans		Hahaha...Baron, what is the Empire?	
0xa6a0	0x98	Volans		I am just doing reseach	for	
				my own academic interest.
0xa704	0x98	Victor		W-What!?	
				That is a bit 	
				problematic...	
0xa75b	0x98	Volans		Hahahahaha.

0xa7bc	0x98	Victor		P-Please don't dodge the

0xaa40	0x98	Pecula		Huhu, as his wife, I'm	mp_0115 0xa964

0xaac1	0x98	Pecula		My husband came to Remnant Island	
				to greet an acquaintance and brought	
				me along for a vacation.	
0xab40	0x98	Pecula		But...	
				Not being able to control that man	
				is pathetic.	
0xab96	0x98	Pecula		Hmph. In the end, he only pretends to have the	
				rank of Baron. He's really no big deal.	
0xac35	0x98	Pecula		When it comes to my husband,	
				not being able to control that man	
				is pathetic.	
0xaca1	0x98	Pecula		Well, since it's rare for me to come here,

talk_Equlea

0x13242	0x41	None	#2E#0W	──Many months have passed

				abandoned their mission and sleep.	
					
				Before long, I, too,	
				will sleep for a long time.#0E	
0x13347	0x41	None	#2E#0W	Before then...

				in Terra-	
				I want to warn them against	
				making the same mistakes.#0E	
0x13473	0x41	None	#2E#0W	There once was a large continent	
				called Lexendria on the surface.	
				There, Mythos and Man shared their	
				vast knowledge and technology, and	
				walked the path of prosperity together.	
					
				However, the humans who had obtained the	
				knowledge and technology, made a mistake	
				in using it.	
0x135e2	0x41	None	#2E#0W	Nature was destroyed,	
				other life was overrun...	
				And war between humans started.	
					
				The countless battles that occurred	
				gradually upset the balance of Power	
				of Stars that composes the world,	
				and the planet's core was damaged.#0E	
0x1372c	0x41	None	#2E#0W	Then, on the day of the greatest	
				battle caused by humans, the planet's	
				core was finally destroyed.	
					
				A large-scale explosion happened	
				in the center of Lexendria, the	
				continent that became the battle front...	
				At that time, nearly the entire world	
				sank into the sea due to the flood it	
				caused.#0E	
0x138a3	0x41	None	#2E#0W	The Mythos, anticipating this outcome, 
				created Terra in hopes of Remaking the
				surface some day.	
				There they built a great city to	
				protect the humans, naming it Lexendria...	
					
				The "destruction" came sooner than expected,	
				and many Mythos	and humans met the same fate	
				as the surface.#0E	
0x13a26	0x41	None	#2E#0W	──To the few sons of man who survived.	
				I want you to feel the state of the Star Capital,	
				where no one exists anymore. I want you to	
				feel this exceedingly futile and sad conclusion.	
					
				I want you to feel the nature and lives	
				the Mythos left behind in "stones."	
				I want you to cherish what was lost.#0E	
0x13bd5	0x41	None	#2E#0W	And, I strongly hope that the same	
				mistakes will never be repeated.	
					
				As humans are beings able to learn	
				from their mistakes.#0E

0x16104	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2

0x16204	0x06	Volans		ANI_WAIT3	
0x1622d	0x98	Volans		It is similar to the falling

0x1633f	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Yes, exactly right.

0x1645f	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2

0x16617	0x06	Volans		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x16643	0x98	Volans		Hehe, our conversation is

0x16933	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Certainly...

0x2cca	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x2cfc	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x2d2e	0x98	ALTO		A-A museum!?	mp_0000 0x180b8
0x2d5a	0x98	ALTO		If I remember correctly, this should have	
				been an empty run-down mansion here...	
0x2dcf	0x98	ALTO		Leaving that aside, Remnant Island has	
				never had anything like a museum...	
0x2e44	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2e76	0x98	ALTO		...I got excited there for a moment.	
				I wonder why this poster's here.	
0x2edb	0x98	ALTO		Maybe it's someone's prank...	
0x2f40	0x98	ALTO		(If it's really a museum, then why?	
				 Hmm, I'm anxious about it...)	
talk_Puppis
0x2fe7	0x98	Puppis		It looks like you've recently	
				finally awakened as a sailor,	
				Crux.	
0x3048	0x98	Puppis		As expected, you must be glad	
				you have a junior sailor.	
0x30a0	0x98	Puppis		...I'm amazed that you still	
				aren't able to swim.	
0x310a	0x98	Crux		Y-You promised	
				not to say that...	
0x317e	0x98	Puppis		mp_0003 0x2fe7
0x31df	0x98	Puppis		Lately, I'm keenly aware that	
				humans, before you realize it,	
				grow.	
0x3291	0x98	Puppis		I'm flabbergasted...	
0x32c7	0x98	Puppis		Though I think Remnant	
				Island is completely	
				mysterious...	
0x3320	0x98	Puppis		Even outside of ruins,	
				for this kind of stuff	
				to fall is...	
0x33a3	0x98	Puppis		mp_0003 0x32c7
0x33fc	0x98	Puppis		Visibility has gotten worse,	
				so I should delay my	
				departure...	
0x3490	0x98	Puppis		...I've felt more relaxed	
				than usual since coming	
				to this island.	
0x34f2	0x98	Puppis		Compared to Saint Cerise,	
				I'm hearing more suspicious	
				stories here.	
0x3555	0x98	Puppis		On the north continent,	
				the rumor is that war	
				will break out soon..	
0x35c0	0x98	Puppis		Gunfire can be often heard	
				near there for many years now.	
				...Good grief.	
0x364c	0x98	Puppis		mp_0003 0x3555	
0x36b7	0x98	Puppis		Sometimes, I'm jealous of	
				you islanders who are all	
				like family.	
0x375f	0x98	Puppis		...Don't worry about Crux.	
				He's just in a bit of trouble.	
0x37f7	0x98	Puppis		Because you're not	
				doing anything either,	
				Crux!	
0x3846	0x98	Crux		Y-Yessir!	
0x3897	0x98	Puppis		Speaking of that, boy,	
				your sister's already	
				better, isn't she?	
0x38f6	0x98	Puppis		I was surprised that her	
				Hell Fever was cured.	
0x3947	0x98	Puppis		Though I'm sure the medicine helped,	
				your sister's a strong woman.	
0x39f1	0x98	Puppis		There are stories handed down	
				among us sailors about	
				Hell Fever.	
0x3a53	0x98	Puppis		That if you keep sailing far	
				out into the ocean, you'll reach	
				the "End of the World," but...	
0x3ac5	0x98	Puppis		If you go near there,	
				you catch an	
				unidentified illness.	
0x3b1c	0x98	Puppis		...Well, also, at End of the	
				World, there's really nothing	
				but a huge storm.	
0x3bb6	0x98	Puppis		If you continue going southwest	
				on the Ciencia Sea, you should	
				arrive at the End of the World.	
0x3c31	0x98	Puppis		But because of that huge storm,	
				nobody wants to visit the	
				actual End.	
0x3ce8	0x98	Puppis		Just when I was about to depart,	
				a ruin falls now?	
0x3d3b	0x98	Puppis		Maybe it's just because of how large	
				it is, but it looks like it fell nearby.	
0x3d94	0x98	Puppis		Even though it happens several	
				times a year in the waters	
				around Remnant Island...	
0x3e0c	0x98	Puppis		It was pretty scary this time around.	
0x3e84	0x98	Puppis		That thing that fell... Even though	
				it's Remnant Island's signature product,	
				it was pretty scary this time around.	
0x3f17	0x98	Puppis		I pray that this sort of thing	
				doesn't happen out on a voyage.	
0x3fb4	0x98	Puppis		Hey boy, so you're making	
				your greeting rounds.	
0x4004	0x98	Puppis		How was your long-awaited	
				homecoming?	
0x404a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, even though it's only	
				been four months, it's as	
				nostalgic as I expected.	
0x40b4	0x98	ALTO		I also wanted to thank you, Captain.
				Letting me slide on board was a	
				big help.	
0x412a	0x98	Puppis		Gahaha, it's nothing.	
				Well, you should at least enjoy	
				your summer vacation.	
0x4194	0x98	Puppis		Though I'm leaving port soon,	
				I'll show my face here again.	
0x41eb	0x98	ALTO		Yes, understood.	
				Please be careful on your way.	
0x4273	0x98	Puppis		Care is always needed for	
				landings at Remnant Island.	
0x42c9	0x98	Puppis		The seabed around the island	
				is full of ruins, and if you're	
				not careful, a ship will run across them.	
0x4351	0x98	Puppis		Even though it's kind of a hassle,	
				stopping the ship and rowing ashore	
				on a tender boat is the best method.	
0x43f7	0x98	Puppis		There's no way I can injure my	
				precious ship.	
0x4445	0x98	Puppis		mp_0003 0x4273	
talk_Crux
0x4529	0x98	Crux		There's still many things	
				I don't understand.	
0x4575	0x98	Crux		But since the captain and my shipmates	
				put their faith in me, I've got to do my	
				best no matter how bad I am.	
0x4602	0x98	Crux		What, various things happened last	
				year and I was able to get through	
				them somehow.	
0x4673	0x98	Crux		One day, I'll travel all over the	
				Ciencia Sea like the captain	
				and be a real sailor!	
0x470d	0x98	Crux		But, since the captain and my shipmates	
				put their faith in my, I've got to do my	
				best no matter what happens.	
0x479a	0x98	Crux		mp_0003 0x4673	
0x485c	0x98	Crux		*shiver*...What happened?	
0x4895	0x98	Crux		It looks like white powder	
				is falling even offshore.	
0x48e8	0x98	Crux		It can't be...	
				It's even falling on the Ciencia Sea!?	
0x4964	0x98	Crux		I-It's cold...	
				Or should I say, I'm cold...	
0x49ae	0x98	Crux		Can it be that this kind of thing	
				is happening on the Ciencia Sea?	
				...Brr! What seriously happened!?	
0x4a4c	0x98	Crux		It'll be time for the ship to leave	
				soon, and we've got to load the	
				passengers.	
0x4ab9	0x98	Crux		...Good grief, it's going to be trouble	
				today. We've got to depart without	
				delay.	
0x4b42	0x98	Crux		*huff*, *huff*...That wench,	
				making me do the impossible...	
0x4bbe	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x4bf0	0x98	ALTO		(Did something happen...?)	
0x4c7a	0x98	Crux		Hey, Captain...	
				Before we depart, please	
				don't tell the story to anyone...	
0x4ce3	0x98	Puppis		In the bottom of the sea, the water and	
				the sky are pitch black, and you	
				can't even see the sun...	
0x4d64	0x98	Puppis		If you fall off the ship, it's the	
				end of the line for you, isn't it, Crux?	
0x4dc7	0x98	Crux		Huuuuuh!?	
				I said, don't threaten me!	
0x4e44	0x6B	Crux		Sweatdrop	
0x4e76	0x98	Crux		That I can't swim might	
				be a serious problem...	
0x4ec4	0x98	Crux		...I've got to at least	
				practice floating...	
0x4f0f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4f91	0x98	Crux		*cough, cough*...	
				I was nervous earlier and	
				sunk into the sea.	
0x4fed	0x98	Crux		If the Captain didn't help me,	
				I don't know what would've happened...	
				Ooh, my life is over!	
0x5086	0x98	Puppis		...Crux, stop being irresponsible	
				and learn to swim already.	
0x50e3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x5157	0x98	Crux		*cough, cough*...	
				If the Captain didn't help me,	
				I don't know what would've happened...	
0x51cc	0x98	Crux		I wonder if I should take	
				swimming practice	
				more seriously.	
0x5245	0x98	Puppis		...Crux,	
				I won't help you next time, you know.	
0x5294	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x52c6	0x98	Crux		Huuuh!?	
				As I thought, I have to practice!!	
0x5360	0x98	Crux		Tch, you're a good guy...	
0x5399	0x98	ALTO		W-What happened	
				all of a sudden, Crux?	
0x53de	0x98	Crux		You see, you're on summer	
				vacation starting now, aren't	
				you?	
0x5438	0x98	Crux		You intend to fully enjoy your	
				beautiful sister, childhood	
				friend, and youth, right?	
0x54aa	0x98	Crux		On the other hand, I get to look forward	
				to a filthy journey at sea with the captain.	
				It's a little unfair, isn't it?	
0x552b	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x55a3	0x98	Puppis		...Crux, if you want to leave this	
				ship that badly, I don't	
				particularly mind.	
0x5611	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x5681	0x98	Crux		N-No, Captain!	
				It was a joke, a joke!	
0x56c5	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...	
				Do your best, Crux.	
0x576e	0x98	Crux		Tch, Captain still doesn't	
				understand humor.	
0x57d9	0x98	Puppis		Crux.	
				Cut the useless chatter	
				and do your work.	
0x5828	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x587a	0x98	Crux		U-Understood!!	
0x58ea	0x98	Crux		Sorry, another time.	
				If I don't do my best work, I don't	
				know what the Captain will do.	
talk_Camelope
0x598f	0x98	Camelope		...That girl has moved here	
				to Remnant Island.	
0x59e0	0x98	Camelope		Good grief, if that girl has come...	
				To think that one of the esteemed Camelope household would	
				escape and hide out on a remote island such as this! Preposterous!	
0x5aa4	0x98	Camelope		I think I will bring her back	
				to the family house soon.	
0x5b26	0x98	Camelope		Good grief, if that girl has come...	
				The traditional Camelope household will	
				run away and hide on this remote island.	
0x5bbd	0x98	Camelope		I'll bring back the head	
				family soon.	
talk_Norma
0x5c31	0x98	Norma		My, my...	
0x5c5b	0x98	Norma		I wonder what is going on with	
				this white powder...	
0x5ce2	0x98	Norma		That girl is already leading	
				a fine life in the village.	
0x5d3a	0x98	Norma		I wonder if doing something like forcibly	
				bringing her back is the right decision,	
				like the lady of the house says.	
0x5dcc	0x98	Norma		I do not know.	
0x5e23	0x98	Norma		I wonder if forcibly bringing milady	
				back is the right decision...	
0x5ebb	0x98	Norma		Milady...	
				The people of the island	
				are listening...	
0x5f28	0x98	Camelope		Be silent, Norma.	
				We're going.	
0x5f69	0x6B	Norma		Unknown	
0x5f9c	0x98	Norma		Y-Yes...	
0x5ffd	0x98	Norma		(Milady...	
				 Be well.)	
0x6032	0x98	Norma		(Ooh, the lady of the house	
				 heard... I'm sure she'll be	
				 angry...)	
talk_Axe
0x60dc	0x98	Axe		Nayuta, it looks like you're	
				sticking your head into	
				things again.	
0x613b	0x98	Axe		Well, because Noi has returned,	
				don't do anything too rash.	
0x6194	0x98	Axe		You can't forget the thankful	
				feelings of everyone who waited	
				for you.	
0x621f	0x98	Axe		mp_0003 0x613b	
0x6278	0x98	Axe		mp_0003 0x6194
0x6311	0x98	Axe		Brr...	Strange powder suddenly	
				starting falling from the sky.	
0x635f	0x98	Axe		And what's worse, it got cold...	
				Damn, what's going to happen now?	
0x63e7	0x98	Axe		With it being this cold, 	
				It'll be hard to catch fish...	
				No, I've got to do something.	
0x644e	0x98	Axe		As if a man of the sea	
				would lose to this cold.	
				Damn.	
0x650a	0x98	Axe		Huh, Eartha is...?	
				I'm worried about her...	
0x6553	0x98	Axe		So that's the reason you and	
				Cygna are searching for	
				herbs...	
0x65ad	0x98	Axe		W-What? Cygna's not with you?	
0x65e9	0x98	Axe		I don't really get it, but anyway,	
				do your best.	
				I'll go visit her later.	
0x6677	0x98	Axe		Your depression too isn't	
				unreasonable. You are	
				close siblings, after all...	
0x66e0	0x98	Axe		However, what will we do without	
				Cygna at a time like this?	
0x676f	0x98	Axe		Which reminds me, I've seen some	
				people calling themselves researchers	
				recently on the island.	
0x67ea	0x98	Axe		It's been about three months...	
				You should look for them	
				around here.	
0x684d	0x98	Axe		They said they were making some	
				preparations... They were strange,	
				no matter how you look at it.	
0x68fe	0x98	Axe		Since about three months ago...	
				Some people calling themselves	
				researchers come by every so often.	
0x6989	0x98	Axe		They said they were	
				making some preparations...	
				I have no idea what for.	
0x6a38	0x98	Axe		...Oh, Nayuta!	
				Haha, it's been a while.	
0x6a7c	0x98	ALTO		Axe!	
				You just got back from	
				fishing just now, right?	
0x6ace	0x98	ALTO		A huge ruin fell at the cape	
				on the other side just now...	
				...Are you all right?	
0x6b3c	0x98	Axe		Yeah, the waves became rough	
				and almost capsized my boat...	
0x6b9c	0x98	Axe		But, somehow, I managed to hold out	
				against it with fighting spirit.	
0x6bf4	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, you're tough, as expected.	
0x6c34	0x98	Axe		Yeah, Carina and the kids are	
				waiting at home. I can't lose	
				to some waves.	
0x6ca6	0x98	Axe		Say, do you intend to go to	
				the fallen ruins, Nayuta?	
0x6cf9	0x98	Axe		You and Cygna never	
				worry about Eartha.	
0x6d40	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I know! ♪	
0x6d6e	0x98	Axe		Good grief...	
				I can't convince you of anything	
				I have to say when you've got	
				that sparkle in your eyes.
0x6e19	0x98	Axe		Though I WAS a little scared back	
				there, well, I still have to do	
				my work without fail.	
0x6e89	0x98	Axe		Now then, I've got to	
				unload today's catch.	
talk_Carina
0x6f34	0x98	Carina		Oh, Nayuta.	
				Thank you for playing	
				with Collie the other day.	
0x6f90	0x98	Carina		Thanks to you,	
				I was saved.	
0x6fcc	0x98	ALTO		Haha, it was an easy thing to do.	
0x700d	0x98	ALTO		It's been awhile since you could go	
				for a date with Axe on his boat.	
				Did you enjoy it?	
0x7081	0x98	Carina		Huhu, somehow,	
				I remembered that newlywed	
				feeling.	
0x70d3	0x98	Carina		Now then, starting today I've got	
				to again enjoy spending time with	
				those troublesome children.	
0x717a	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, thank you for playing with	
				Collie and the others yesterday.	
0x71de	0x98	Carina		Starting today I've got	
				to again enjoy spending time with	
				those troublesome children.	
0x7289	0x98	Carina		Though Axe was bringing fish...	
				The conditions became strange	
				and he returned earlier than usual.	
0x730a	0x98	Carina		I wonder what's happening...	
				This is the first time I've seen	
				weather like this...	
0x73a4	0x98	Carina		I've got to bring Vel and Collie	
				to see this weather.	
0x73fa	0x98	Carina		Though it would be good they don't	
				get sick due to this cold...	
0x7490	0x98	Carina		Eartha said she was treating us	
				to a feast tonight to celebrate	
				her complete recovery.	
0x7506	0x98	Carina		I'll gather up some fish to bring.	
				Be sure to enjoy it too, Nayuta.	
0x756a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, yes!	
0x75bd	0x98	Carina		Now then, I've got to call Axe.	
0x75fe	0x98	Carina		Before long, I'll need to ask	
				Lyra to look after Collie.	
0x7657	0x98	Carina		Huhu, when you and Cygna	
				weren't around, she helped	
				us with this many times.	
0x7719	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, thank you for	
				playing with Vel.	
0x7761	0x98	Carina		I'll make time to play with	
				her very soon.	
0x77d4	0x98	baby		Babu...	
0x781b	0x98	Carina		Huhu, I wonder if	
				Collie wanted to play too.	
0x789c	0x98	Carina		From time to time, it seems like Vel	
				looks enviously at Collie and I.	
0x7902	0x98	Carina		Because Axe and I need to look	
				after Collie all the time, it must	
				make her lonely.	
0x7974	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, if you have time,	
				please play with Vel, too.	
0x79f1	0x98	Carina		Because we are looking after Collie,	
				it must be making Vel feel lonely.	
0x7a59	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, if you have time,	mp_0003 0x7974
				please play with Vel, too.	
0x7ae6	0x98	Carina		You see, when Axe was finishing,	
				this kind of ruin fell...	
				It gave me a chill.	
0x7b54	0x98	Carina		Huhu, but I'm glad he	
				came home safely㈱	
				Safety of family is first.	
0x7c13	0x98	Carina		Look Collie,	
				your father's home!	
0x7c54	0x98	baby		Gaga.	
0x7cbd	0x98	Carina		Huhu, Nayuta.	
				Have you finished	
				greeting Axe?	
0x7d0a	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, just now.	
0x7d39	0x98	ALTO		Speaking of that, that baby...	
				He was born when we were	
				away, wasn't he?	
0x7d9f	0x98	Carina		Huhu, that's right.	
				His name is "Collie."	
0x7e09	0x98	Carina		Now, Collie.	
				Won't you greet your	
				big brother Nayuta?	
0x7e5e	0x98	baby		Abubu.	
0x7e84	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, she's so cute♪	
0x7eba	0x98	ALTO		I can only imagine the many hardships you must have	
				faced during your pregnancy. However, now that she's	
				been born, there are even more difficulties, huh?	
0x7f72	0x98	ALTO		Don't hesitate to call the Handyman Shop	
				if you need help with anything.	
0x7fe7	0x98	Carina		Huhu, then when that time comes,	
				I'll rely on your help.	
0x807a	0x98	Carina		My husband Axe left	
				to go fishing just now.	
0x80c6	0x98	Carina		I think he'll be back very soon.

0x81af	0x98	Carina		I think he'll be back very soon.	mp_0003 0x80c6

talk_Bell
0x82b8	0x98	Bell		Noi, do you remember Vel?	
0x82f1	0x98	Bell		Though the previous Noi	
				helped Vel...	
0x8335	0x98	NOI		...I'm sorry.	
				That time is	
				no exception...	
0x837c	0x98	Bell		Hmm...	
				I don't get it.	
0x83b1	0x98	Bell		To Vel,	
				Noi is Noi.	
				That is all.	
0x83ef	0x98	NOI		Though I am Noi herself, ...	
0x842a	0x98	ALTO		Haha, yes you are.	
0x8496	0x98	Bell		To Vel,	mp_0003 0x83b1
				Noi is Noi.	
				That is all.	
0x84d4	0x98	Bell		Noi, let's play	
				with Collie	
				together again!	
0x851d	0x98	NOI		Y-Yes.	
0x856a	0x98	Bell		Noi, let's play	mp_0003 0x84d4
				with Collie	
				together again!	
0x85cf	0x98	Bell		My father and mother	
				are back!	
0x8638	0x98	Bell		Father, mother!	
				...What is this cold stuff!?	
0x86b7	0x98	Bell		My father and mother	
				went to work.	
0x86f8	0x98	Bell		Though I'm a little lonely,	
				it's work...	
				It can't be helped...	
0x8754	0x98	Bell		...Even though at times like this,	
				big brother Cygna comes	
				to play with me...	
0x87e7	0x98	Bell		...Vel won't cry.	
0x8818	0x98	Bell		Right, big sister Lyra is looking	
				after Collie for me.	
				I've got to meet her later!	
0x88be	0x98	Bell		Ehehe, today, Vel will	
				try to care for Collie.	
0x890b	0x98	ALTO		Ah, indeed...	
				Hehe, that's great.	
0x894b	0x98	Bell		Hmph, no matter what you	
				say, I'm Collie's big sister!	
0x89be	0x98	Bell		Now Collie, something is	
				sinking into the sea.	
				I wonder what it is?	
0x8a1f	0x98	baby		Babubu.	
0x8a46	0x6B	Bell		Unknown	
0x8a78	0x98	Bell		Yes, right answer!!	
				This answer is a	
				glorious achievement!!	
0x8ad1	0x98	ALTO		(Hmm, a while back, I remember	
				 that Cygna cared for Vel...)	
0x8b7e	0x98	Bell		Now Collie, I wonder what	
				is drying in front of our house?	
0x8bd7	0x98	Bell		Too bad, time's up!	
				The answer was fish!!	
0x8c1f	0x98	baby		Abubu...

0x8d22	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x8d53	0x98	NOI		N-Not so much...	
0x8d82	0x98	ALTO		Now, now.	
				It's baby talk.	
0x8dfa	0x98	Collie		A big bug...	
				(Dejected...)	
0x8e3f	0x98	Collie		A big bug...	
0x8e6d	0x98	Collie		I want one too.

talk_Hydol
0x8f4e	0x98	Hydol		W-What in the world is this...	
				What is happening?	
0x8f9f	0x98	Hydol		It seems that "snow" is falling.	
				This is my first time seeing it too...	
0x902e	0x98	Hydol		Hmm... Furthermore, it seems as if	
				it's getting colder.	
0x907e	0x98	Hydol		I wonder if ships will leave in a	
				situation like this. I'm getting	
				worried...	
0x9120	0x98	Hydol		Hey, Nayuta.	
0x914d	0x98	Hydol		Now that I've confirmed Eartha's complete	
				recovery, it's about time I returned to the	
				Medical Clinic.	
0x91d1	0x98	Hydol		Ooh, since I've stayed here for	
				so long, the work has certainly been	
				piling up. I'm afraid to go back.	
0x9282	0x98	Hydol		Though there's still time until departure,	
				I've got to sort my patient charts, so	
				I'll get on board ahead of time.	
0x9311	0x98	Hydol		Though I'd like to live at a leisurely pace

talk_Mensa
0x93f2	0x98	Mensa		...There's no mistake that "he"

0x9440	0x98	Ophiuchus		It was information from a reliable source...	
				It is not likely that there's

0x94ba	0x98	Mensa		...Phew, we can finally	
				grab him by the tail.	
0x9507	0x98	Mensa		...I'll search for him.	
0x9585	0x98	Mensa		Though I searched for him

0x95d4	0x98	Mensa		...Phew, we can finally	mp_0003 0x94ba
				grab him by the tail.

0x982e	0x98	Ophiuchus		It seems this will go well.	
talk_Antlia
0x989c	0x98	Antlia		I've heard about "snow" many times	
				from my trader associates.	
0x98fa	0x98	Antlia		In the north sea, snow obscures one's	
				field of vision so much that you can't	
				sail normally...	
0x9977	0x98	Antlia		I must remember this day when	
				"snow" appeared unexpectedly.	
0x99fb	0x98	Antlia		I must remember this day,	
				when "snow" appeared.	
0x9a4b	0x98	Antlia		However, this sudden cooling...	
				I get the feeling that it is	
				unnatural.	
talk_Ursaminor
0x9bcb	0x98	Ursaminor		I'm glad that my sister and	
				brother Cetus seem fine.	
0x9c23	0x98	Ursaminor		I wonder what kind of treasures	
				they found on their adventure this time.	
0x9c8f	0x98	Ursaminor		Huhu, I hope they treat me	
				to some of it.	
0x9d04	0x98	Ursaminor		I wonder what kind of treasures

0x9d6f	0x98	Ursaminor		Huhu, I hope they treat me	mp_0003 0x9c8f
				to some of it.	
0x9df4	0x98	Ursaminor		Though this is the place I'll return	
				to from now on...	
0x9e4e	0x98	Ursaminor		...Even so, everyone's in an uproar.	
0x9ebf	0x98	Ursaminor		...Everyone's in an uproar.	
0x9eff	0x98	Ursaminor		...I hope sister

talk_Ursaminor_Reticul
0x9f5c	0x98	Ursaminor		S-S-S....Sister...!?	
0x9f95	0x98	Ursaminor		You're my real sister...	
				Why have you come to this island?	
0x9ffb	0x3F	Name		Spirited Girl	
0xa010	0x98	Reticul		I'm the one who's surprised.	
				Why are you here?	
0xa060	0x98	Reticul		Hey, father has traded around here	
				for a long time, hasn't he.	
				...Sorry, I forgot.	
0xa0db	0x3F	Name		Youth with Rucksack	
0xa0f6	0x98	Cetus		Speaking of "Remnant Island,"	
				rumors say it's at the center of	
				recent incidents.	
0xa165	0x98	Cetus		We heard the stories and came	
				running, but...	
				Ah, we got a late start.	
0xa1da	0x98	Ursaminor		You two...*cry*...	
				I'm glad you're safe...

0xa2f7	0x98	Ursaminor		You two...*cry*...	
				Thank goodness you're all right...	
0xa350	0x98	Ursaminor		Where were you and what were

0xa3a8	0x98	Ursaminor		You weren't doing anything

0xa403	0x3F	Name		Spirited Girl	mp_0003 0x9ffb
0xa418	0x98	Reticul		W-Well, you see...	
0xa44d	0x98	Reticul		Anyhow, keep it a secret	
				from father that we met here.	
				Please!	
talk_Vavo
0xa4f0	0x98	Vavo		There is a theory that past the	
				"End of the World," there is a	
				bottomless "Hell."	
0xa55f	0x98	Vavo		Because the northern continent is close	
				to the "End," the outbreak of disease	
				there was called Hell Fever, but...	
0xa5f0	0x98	Vavo		...The truth is, lately, that "End" is	
				coming steadily closer to here...	
				That's what the rumors say.	
0xa672	0x98	Vavo		That Hell Fever broke out on the island...	
				It might not be a simple coincidence.	
0xa70b	0x98	Vavo		Something like hearing the name	
				Hell Fever on this island...	
0xa768	0x98	Vavo		There are rumors that "The End of the	
				World" is approaching, and it might not	
				be a simple coincidence...	
0xa80a	0x98	Vavo		Oh, you have a request	
				for Dr. Volans?	
0xa84f	0x98	Vavo		As always, he is in meditation	
				within the museum.	
0xa8d3	0x98	Vavo		Dr. Volans often turns his hand to	
				research outside the fields of history	
				and natural history.	
0xa94f	0x98	Vavo		His ideas are original,	
				and of great interest.	
0xa99c	0x98	Vavo		I should listen to young	
				scholars from time to time	
				as well.	
0xaa1e	0x98	Vavo		Dr. Volans' ideas are interesting	
				and original.	
0xaa6c	0x98	Vavo		I should listen to young	mp_0003 0xa99c

talk_Creha
0xaaf6	0x98	Creha		Nayuta...

0xab2c	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I'm worried about

0xab74	0x98	ALTO		Umm... Anyway, it looks	
				like you're helping out?	
0xabc3	0x98	Creha		Yes...I am looking	
				after the baby.	
0xac05	0x98	Creha		...It's very warm...	
0xac3a	0x98	Creha		Just by being like this,	
				I can feel it's a very	
				precious thing...	
0xac97	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0xacc9	0x98	Lyra		A-Ahem...	
0xacf2	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xad24	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0xad56	0x98	ALTO		Ah, umm...	
0xad80	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, stay in high spirits,	
				and don't overdo it.	
0xadd1	0x98	ALTO		If you collapsed, Eartha, Noi	
				and I would all be worried	
				about you...	
0xae34	0x98	Creha		...Understood.	
				I'll be careful.	
0xae9b	0x98	Creha		Babies are strange...	
0xaed1	0x98	Creha		Just like this, I get a	
				strange feeling...

0xb0cd	0x98	ALTO		Umm, Lyra, you're with Kureha?	
0xb128	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, I guess...	
0xb158	0x6B	Lyra		Ellipsis	
0xb18a	0x98	Lyra		You're a cheater.	
0xb1bb	0x98	ALTO		Eh, huh?	
0xb1e3	0x98	Lyra		...Nevermind.	
				I just wanted to try	
				saying it is all.	
0xb281	0x98	Lyra		Even so, she doesn't	
				even know how to	
				comfort a child...	
0xb2d7	0x98	Lyra		Hmm...is she the daughter of some	
				noble family somewhere? But I feel	
				like that's not it at all...	
0xb34f	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...	
				Lyra, I don't think you should	
				think about it too much.	
0xb3aa	0x98	Lyra		...Quiet, Nayuta.	
0xb3da	0x98	ALTO		(It seems like she's in a bad mood today.)	
0xb45e	0x98	Lyra		(So it's become

0xb49f	0x98	Lyra		(Even though I don't care about Nayuta,

0xb50a	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
talk_Cetus
0xb5c2	0x3F	Name		mp_0003 0xa0db
0xb5dd	0x98	Cetus		Though as an adventurer, I wanted to visit	
				"Remnant Island" for some time...	
				As expected, I got a late start.	
0xb669	0x98	Cetus		Well, that we met here must be fate.	
				I've got to say hi to uncle, too.	
0xb705	0x98	Cetus		Yo, Nayuta and Noi.	
				It's been awhile since we met.	
0xb757	0x98	ALTO		Cetus!	
				It's been awhile.	
0xb78e	0x98	ALTO		I heard that you've been travelling	
				around the world with Reticul	
				since then, though.	
0xb801	0x98	Cetus		Yeah, we saw the Ciencia Sea, the north	
				continent, and the east islands.	
0xb869	0x98	Cetus		Reticul's become an official adventurer.	
				Though her personality's the same as	
				ever, she's acquired some skill.	
0xb8f6	0x98	NOI		And adventure, huh...	
				I'm envious.	
0xb936	0x98	Cetus		Haha, if you like,	
				I could again go adventuring	
				with you, Nayuta.	
0xb996	0x98	Cetus		If it's the combination of you two,	
				I'm sure you could become	
				good adventurers.	
0xba46	0x98	Cetus		If you want a break from Remnant Island,	
				I think you should aim for "The Tip of	
				the World."	
0xbac0	0x98	Cetus		The thing that appeared "after"	
				"The End of the World"...Nothing tickles	
				my adventurer spirit more.	
0xbb42	0x98	Cetus		Nayuta, are you aiming to be an	
				adventurer someday?	
				I think it would suit you.	
0xbbd7	0x98	Cetus		The thing that appeared "after"	mp_0003 0xbac0
				"The End of the World"...Nothing tickles

0xbc59	0x98	Cetus		I don't know what kind of world will

				I'm excited.	
talk_Reticul
0xbda2	0x98	Reticul		This year, I travelled to various places,

				The more I adventure, the more mysteries

0xbea4	0x98	Reticul		Good grief, I wonder how wide the world is.

0xc48e	0x98	Aquela		It seems that there was

				No matter how you look at it,

0xc6f7	0x98	Aquela		As if she is not of this world.	
				She somehow has a sense	
				of unreality to her...	
0xc766	0x98	Aquela		...Huhu, this is excellent.	
				I must divine what her

0xc7fc	0x98	Aquela		I must divine what her

0xc854	0x98	Aquela		I only wish for there

0xc8d3	0x98	Aquela		For several years, the climate

0xc93f	0x98	Aquela		And in my fortunes, I get the

0xca14	0x98	Aquela		The waves of that may reappear.

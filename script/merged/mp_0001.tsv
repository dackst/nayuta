0x1636e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Speaking of which, what

0x163d2	0x98	Creha		Um... I've been helping out the

0x16457	0x98	Creha		You know, the moons are beautiful.

0x16678	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Really, I guess you're not

0x166ea	0x98	Creha	#0W	Huh...?	
0x16803	0x98	ALTO	#6A	You clearly have tremendous

0x1685c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	But you used that power

0x16ae9	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x16b18	0x98	Creha		...No, not at all.	
0x16b50	0x98	Creha		If I'm like that...

0x16bce	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Huh...?	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x16d59	0x98	Creha	#1W	...As I watched you in Terra,

0x16dbd	0x98	Creha	#1W	You so desperately searched for

0x16e41	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x16e76	0x98	Creha	#1W	No, even before that...

0x1702f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x17064	0x98	ALTO	#2W#6A	Help others...?

0x170bf	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	That is pretty much the core

0x17132	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x1716e	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	Ahaha, maybe I am the one

0x171e4	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x17219	0x98	Creha	#2W	No, I came to this island

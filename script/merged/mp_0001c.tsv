talk_Dorado
0xce5	0x98	Dorado		Because that strong monster

0xd49	0x98	Dorado		I'll consult with Orvus	
				and protect the village	
				somehow.	
0xdab	0x98	Dorado		Truly, thanks for saving	
				Lyra and Vel for me.	
0xdf9	0x98	Dorado		...But, I can't believe such

				...............	
0xe62	0x98	Dorado		W-Well, even if I'm depressed,	
				it can't be helped.	
0xeb5	0x98	Dorado		I'll consult with Orvus now	
				and protect the village	
				somehow.	
0xf3b	0x98	ALTO		Dorado,	
				is it alright for you to	
				be awake already?	
0xf8b	0x98	Dorado		Yeah, my wound	
				wasn't serious.	
0xfca	0x98	Dorado		However, thanks to you	
				and Orvus, I was saved.	
0x1019	0x98	Dorado		Truly, thanks for saving	mp_0001c 0xdab
				Lyra and Vel for me.	
0x10a1	0x40	UNDEF		Dorado has lost consciousness.	mp_0000d 0xfab
0x112a	0x98	Dorado		Nayuta, cheer up.	
				That Cygna guy will	
				return at any moment.	
0x118f	0x98	Dorado		...It looks like that Cygna

0x11e6	0x98	Dorado		If it's him,	
				you don't need to worry,	
				he'll return soon.	
0x123e	0x98	Dorado		Even Kureha...

0x1280	0x98	Dorado		A-Anyway, cheer up, OK?	
talk_Ursaminor
0x133d	0x98	Ursaminor		I heard a monster came out,	
				and was worried and came, but...	
0x139d	0x98	Ursaminor		...It is not the case that	
				my sister is on this island.	
0x13f8	0x98	Ursaminor		But...when I hear this kind of story,	
				I have to come.	
				I think about what might happen...	
0x149b	0x98	Ursaminor		My sister might be in trouble	
				somewhere, maybe...	
0x14f0	0x98	Ursaminor		...............	mp_0001 0xc917
0x154a	0x98	Ursaminor		As I thought, my sister	
				and brother Cetus are	
				reliable...	
0x15a6	0x98	Ursaminor		I too will come help father.	
0x160f	0x98	Ursaminor		If you leave this place to my sister,	
				everything will be all right.	
0x1676	0x98	Ursaminor		I too will come help father.	mp_0001c 0x15a6
talk_Bootie
0x16e9	0x98	Bootie		Though that split moon is amazing,	
				I got tired of looking at it immediately.	
0x1756	0x98	Bootie		I want to explore another world.	
				...If Dorado let me enter, that is.	
0x17e3	0x98	Bootie		It seems there are many "Star Shards"	
				in that super-huge gear ruin that just	
				fell down from the other world.	
0x186f	0x98	Bootie		Hehe, I think I'll sneak inside when	
				brother Dorado isn't around.	
talk_Bell
0x18ff	0x98	Bell		All the adults are busy.	
0x1937	0x98	Bell		...Vel is booored.	
				I want to play somewhere!	
0x19aa	0x98	Bell		Because it'll be the festival season	
				very soon, everyone seems so	
				busy.	
0x1a0f	0x98	Bell		I heard there might not be a festival	
				this year.	
				I'm dejected...	
talk_Lyra
0x1a9b	0x98	Lyra		Another world on the moon, huh...	
0x1adc	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, until now, you've been fighting	
				in that distant place, haven't you.	
0x1b46	0x98	Lyra		And now, for Kureha and	
				Cygna...	
0x1b85	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, please don't worry and wait.	
0x1bc7	0x98	ALTO		Both Noi and I,	
				we will definitely return safely.	
0x1c17	0x98	ALTO		I'm sure...	
				I will definitely bring	
				Kureha and Cygna with me.	
0x1c72	0x6B	Lyra		Ellipsis	
0x1ca4	0x98	Lyra		(...As expected, Nayuta is Nayuta.)	
0x1ce7	0x98	Lyra		(From when I first met him, he hasn't	
				 changed. He's my special boy...)	
0x1d4d	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x1d77	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x1da8	0x98	NOI		What's wrong? You're staring	
				at Nayuta so long and hard...	
0x1e15	0x98	Lyra		Huhu, it's nothing.	
0x1e5e	0x98	Lyra		...Well, as much as possible,	
				try not to get hurt.	
0x1eaf	0x98	Lyra		Once everything is over, we'll	
				celebrate at my shop with	
				enthusiasm.	
0x1f11	0x98	ALTO		Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x1f36	0x98	NOI		Absolutely!	
0x1f9a	0x98	Lyra		Definitely bring back	
				Cygna and Kureha,	
				you two.	
0x1fe8	0x98	Lyra		Once everything is over, we'll	mp_0001c 0x1eaf
				celebrate at my shop with	
				enthusiasm.	
0x204a	0x98	Lyra		I'll just say this:	
				If you're not there,	
				I won't forgive you, y'know?	
0x20ad	0x98	ALTO		Yeah...got it.	
0x20db	0x98	NOI		Leave it to us!	
0x2131	0x98	Lyra		Once everything is over, we'll	mp_0001c 0x1eaf

0x2193	0x98	Lyra		I'll just say this:	mp_0001c 0x204a

talk_Cetus
0x2295	0x98	Cetus		Though someone like me	
				doesn't know what will happen	
				to this world from now on...	
0x2305	0x98	Cetus		There's no method for peace	
				other than that Terra and this	
				world to recognize each other.	
0x237f	0x98	Cetus		...When you see that	
				beautiful world, you can't	
				bear a grudge.	
0x2404	0x98	Cetus		Though it seems that Terra	
				will erase us...	
				I don't bear any grudge.	
0x2469	0x98	Cetus		Well for right now, we should do as Reticul	
				said. Getting through these abnormalities	
				together is top priority.	
0x24f7	0x98	Cetus		Nayuta, Noi...	
				We'll leave Terra to you.	
0x2579	0x98	Cetus		Monsters might appear around	
				here again. We've decided to	
				take care of it.	
0x25e2	0x98	Cetus		However, Orvus Alhazen, the master	
				fencer of this island, retired...	
0x2646	0x98	Cetus		There's no one among adventurers who	
				doesn't know that name. Around the world,	
				there's many legendary anecdotes about him.	
0x26df	0x98	Cetus		...If it wasn't a time like this,	
				I too would want to learn the basics.	
0x276e	0x98	Cetus		We stopped for awhile on this island	
				to help remove rubble.	
0x27c9	0x98	Cetus		Please leave this to us, and go to	
				Terra without any reservation.	
				I'm expecting good news, you two!	
talk_Cetus_and_Reticul
0x287d	0x98	Cetus		Reticul, do you really intend to	
				return to your uncle's home?	
0x28da	0x98	Cetus		Though it's a long-awaited reconciliation...	
				Ursamina said she's very worried	
				about me.	
0x2972	0x98	Reticul		It's fine Cetus.	
				Though certainly father's gloominess	
				has cleared up...	
0x29da	0x98	Reticul		I love adventure and treasure hunting,	
				and in the end, leaving home was	
				a big chance for me.	
0x2a57	0x98	Reticul		Ursamina gave her consent too...	
				Anyway for now, let's think of a	
				way to get through these abnormalities.	
0x2ae1	0x98	Cetus		...Huhu, that's right.	
				You're certainly right.	
0x2b2f	0x98	Cetus		Dear me, before I knew it,	
				you became an adult...	
0x2b80	0x6B	Reticul		Unknown	
0x2bb5	0x98	Reticul		W-What is with you.	
				Jeez, Cetus...	
talk_Reticul
0x2cf0	0x98	Reticul		I spoke with father, and was finally	
				able to reconcile with him.	
0x2d52	0x98	Reticul		He allowed me to talk about	
				my dream as an adventurer...	
				Ursamina gave her consent too.	
0x2dca	0x98	Reticul		I pray for this world to return	
				to normal so I can have more	
				enjoyable adventures within it.	
0x2e6f	0x98	Reticul		I spoke with my father and	
				various disagreements	
				were solved.	
0x2ecd	0x98	Reticul		I pray for this world to return	mp_0001c 0x2dca
				to normal so I can have more	
				enjoyable adventures within it.	
0x2f82	0x98	Reticul		Making up with my father...	
				For Ursamina too, I should	
				seriously think about it.	
0x2ff3	0x98	ALTO		In the end, why was I	
				fighting with father again?	
0x3043	0x98	Reticul		...Well, that's often the case.	
0x3085	0x98	Reticul		Since I long time ago, I loved adventuring	
				and treasure hunting, and I wanted to be	
				an adventurer like Cetus in the future.	
0x3121	0x98	Reticul		However, father said, "Adventuring is not	
				something women do," and didn't give	
				his permission.	
0x31a0	0x98	NOI		Is that so...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x31cc	0x98	Reticul		Well, the number one reason I left	
				was because father at the fish cake	
				in the cupboard.	
0x3244	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3276	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x32a7	0x98	ALTO		(T-That's pretty trivial...)	
0x32e3	0x98	ALTO		(But, this is how fights between	
				 parents and children are, I guess.)	
0x3389	0x98	Reticul		The reason I left home was...	
				Well, it was a grudge over food.	
0x33e9	0x98	Reticul		Even I, if I think about it now,	
				I think "why did I do that?"	
0x3448	0x98	Reticul		Including the thing about going against	
				my dream, we just needed to talk	
				about it more.	
0x34e8	0x98	Reticul		...Somehow, if we talk about it,	
				I feel like things will get easier.	
0x354e	0x98	Reticul		As expected, I'll seize this chance	
				to talk with father.

0x3718	0x98	ALTO		If I have this, I can give	mp_0001 0x3989

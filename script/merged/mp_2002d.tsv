0x1a94	0x40	UNDEF		The Moon Bird eggs have been placed.	
0x1ad9	0x98	NOI		Let's try changing the season to	
				Summer and coming back here again.	
0x1b3b	0x98	NOI		Hopefully there'll be some

0x1f81	0x98	ALTO	#6A	This place... It's almost like	
				a little cave has formed.	
0x1fee	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It should be safe for a bird's nest,	
				as long as as it's high enough to be	
				out of the reach of monsters.	
0x207b	0x98	NOI	#6A	It seems to fit being	
				in a cold area too...

0x2119	0x98	NOI	#6A	This must be the perfect place

0x23d8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	All right, I think we're good to go.

0x8bd	0x98	Keny		It's nice to be able to	
				see Noi again, but...	
				She lost her memory, right?	
0x922	0x98	Keny		Though life is full of enjoyment.	
0x96d	0x98	Keny		You can always make as many new	
				memories as you want in the future.	
0x9e2	0x98	Keny		Life is full of enjoyment.	
0xa28	0x98	Keny		You've got to make many	mp_0114 0x96d
				memories starting now.	
0xaab	0x98	Keny		My, if it isn't Nayuta!	
				You've got a date with	
				Lyra today, right?	
0xb0a	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb3c	0x98	ALTO		No, we just agreed to meet...	
				How do you even know about that?	
0xb97	0x98	Keny		Heheh, never underestimate	
				the housewife community.
0xbe6	0x98	Keny		If something happens in the village, you	
				can bet your life that word gets around!	
0xc39	0x98	ALTO		Th-That's what I get	
				from a country town...	
0xca2	0x98	Keny		Ohoho, good luck on your date.	
0xce4	0x98	Keny		We'll be rooting for you	
				from behind the bushes.	
0xd44	0x98	ALTO		(Good grief...)	
0xda9	0x98	Keny		Though it's just a rumor...	
				They say that this crazy	
				weather is only getting worse.	
0xe15	0x98	Keny		For some reason, tons of	
				people on the continent are	
				getting sick with Hell Fever...	
0xe82	0x98	Keny		Scary stuff, huh?	
				Just what is happening	
				to the world...?
0xefe	0x98	Keny		No, this is no time to be	
				afraid of mere rumors!
0xf41	0x98	Keny		No matter what happens, I won't be defeated.
				Never underestimate a housewife with kids!
0xffb	0x98	Keny		Oh, man. He is in for it now!	
0x1068	0x98	Keny		But still, the only thing that	
				was keeping Boote from getting	
				hurt was Dorado, it seems.
0x10e5	0x98	Keny		I'll have to make him cookies	
				later to thank him.	
0x1156	0x98	Keny		Oh my... You two seem like you're	
				feeling back to your normal selves.
0x11bd	0x98	Keny		Hehe, that's the way it should be.	
				We all have a lot of difficulties to	
				overcome, but we can do it together.
0x1261	0x98	Keny		It's kinda dreary outside, isn't it?	
				We've been having some crazy weather.	
0x12bf	0x98	Keny		Since this weather started, a lot of	
				crops everywhere suddenly started dying.	
0x132a	0x98	Keny		Our crops are still fine, but...	
				Jessica hasn't been producing as	
				much milk as before...	
0x138f	0x98	Keny		Ah, there's nothing good to say about this	
				situation... All we can do during a time	
				like this is try to power through it.	
0x1443	0x98	Keny		All we can do during a time like this	
				is try to power through it. Time to	
				take out the emergency food supplies.
0x14bf	0x98	Keny		While the men are all working,	
				Eartha and I have been making and	
				distributing food for everyone.
0x1574	0x98	Keny		Nayuta, don't overdo it and	
				go do something dangerous.	
0x15cd	0x98	Keny		If you got hurt or anything,	
				Eartha would be sad, you know.	
0x1611	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I know... I promise	
				I'll come back in one piece.	
0x1661	0x98	ALTO		And of course, I'll have Kureha with me.	
0x16a6	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, that's my boy, Nayuta!	
0x1716	0x98	Keny		At any rate, be careful.	
0x1754	0x98	Keny		mp_0114 0x15cd
0x17ce	0x98	Keny		Ah, this can't be good...	
0x1804	0x98	Keny		The weather has never been like	
				this ever since I came to Remnant	
				Island after I got married.	
0x1883	0x98	Keny		After what happened to Eartha...	
				I'll have to be careful not to	
				let Boote get sick too.	
0x1920	0x98	Keny		mp_0114 0x1804	
0x199f	0x98	Keny		mp_0114 0x1883	
0x1a30	0x98	Keny		The whole island is going nuts over	
				this Kureha girl helping everyone.	
0x1a8c	0x98	Keny		The way she talks is a little odd.	
				She seems unreliable at first, but	
				picks up things unexpectedly fast.	
0x1b26	0x98	Keny		I wonder if she will help with our field again.	
				We're short of hands for the harvest season.	
0x1bb6	0x98	Keny		I hear a beautiful young lady is	
				staying at your place, Nayuta.	
0x1c11	0x98	Keny		I saw her earlier.	
				She was very graceful.	
0x1c64	0x98	Keny		She has a somewhat noble air about her.	
				Maybe she's the daughter of a noble.	
0x1d0c	0x98	Keny		Ah... I'm so relieved.	
				Thank goodness Eartha	
				recovered from her illness.	
0x1d67	0x98	Keny		Nayuta, if you're ever in any	
				trouble in the future, don't	
				hesitate to tell me, okay?	
0x1dc9	0x98	Keny		The adults of this village are	
				your foster parents, after all.	
0x1e4a	0x98	Keny		mp_0114 0x1d67	
0x1eac	0x98	Keny		mp_0114 0x1dc9
0x1f21	0x98	Keny		This isn't good...	
				I've gotta go visit her.	
0x1f6c	0x98	Keny		Hmm, I'll bring tomatoes, and carrots, and...	
				Maybe I shouldn't bring eggplant...	
0x201a	0x98	Keny		That Boote, he even lied	
				to Sasha to help him hide.	
0x2063	0x98	Keny		Jeez, this definitely deserves	
				some kind of punishment.	
0x20ab	0x98	Keny		I need to get Dr. Hydrol to	
				prescribe him even more	
				bitter medicine than before.
0x2162	0x98	Keny		Speaking of which, Dr. Hydrol should	
				be coming to the island soon.	
0x21c8	0x98	Keny		It's really helpful of the doctor	
				to come all the way here～.	
0x221f	0x98	Keny		If any of us comes down with a cold,	
				it's not exactly a short walk to get	
				to San Ceriz Medical Clinic.	
0x22a1	0x98	Keny		Looks like Dr. Hydrol is here.	
0x22e2	0x98	Keny		Hehe, he's always such a big help.	
				I should share some vegetables with him.	
0x23a6	0x98	Keny		I was suddenly given a	
				present out of nowhere...	
				That was a nice surprise.	
0x2421	0x98	Keny		You were the one who chose this	
				flower for me, Nayuta, weren't you?	
				Heheh, I must thank you, too.	
0x24ab	0x98	Keny		I was suddenly given a	
				present out of nowhere...	
0x2507	0x98	Keny		I can't believe he's still worried about	
				our wedding anniversary the other day.	
0x2565	0x98	Keny		Hehe, that's just	
				like my husband.	
0x25e2	0x98	Keny		If you're looking for our	
				Boote, he went to play in	
				the new ruins that fell.	
0x2640	0x98	Keny		He's collecting star shards.	
				Heh, he never gets tired of those things.	
0x26ae	0x98	Keny		Well, they're such beautiful stones, it's	
				understandable to want to collect them.	
0x2740	0x98	Keny		I remember you collect star	
				shards too, don't you?	
0x27a1	0x98	Keny		Well, if it is those pretty stones,	mp_0114 0x26ae
				wanting to collect them can't	
				be helped.	
0x2841	0x98	Keny		Whoa, that just scared the life out of me...	
				That was more ruins falling, wasn't it?	
0x289d	0x98	Keny		Our Boote ran off to see it,	
				and now you're going to look	
				at it too, right?	
0x28fd	0x98	Keny		Heheh, I won't stop you, but make	
				sure to be careful on your way.	
0x297a	0x98	Keny		I'm used to having small	
				pieces of rubble fall, but...	
0x29d1	0x98	Keny		Goodness, this is going to	
				be a big mess to clean up.	
0x2a52	0x98	Keny		My, is that Nayuta?	
				Long time no see!	
0x2a9a	0x98	ALTO		Hello, Mrs. Canie...	
0x2acc	0x98	Keny		Shuddap!!	
0x2af5	0x98	Keny		It's─just─Canie.	
				...Got it?	
0x2b35	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2b67	0x98	ALTO		...Hello, Canie.	
0x2b9f	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, very good!	
0x2bd0	0x98	Keny		Can you play with	
				my Boote again	
				while you are here?	
0x2c25	0x98	Keny		He's been pretty sad while	
				you and Cygna were away.	
0x2c77	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, is that so?	
				Got it, Mrs. Can─	
0x2cb8	0x98	Keny		Hmm? (*grin*)	
0x2ce4	0x98	ALTO		...C-Canie.	
0x2d4e	0x98	Keny		Hehe, you're as nice and	
				adorable as ever, Nayuta.	
0x2d8f	0x98	Keny		And...I heard you restarted	
				the Handyman Shop with Cygna?	
0x2de4	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, way to go!	
				Maybe I'll ask you to help	
				with the field work again～.	
0x2e5c	0x98	ALTO		Hahaha, I'll be looking	
				forward to it, Mi..uh, Canie.	
0x2ed2	0x98	Keny		You and Cygna are both so	
				energetic and vibrant!	
				That's nice~.	
0x2f38	0x98	Keny		Maybe I'll negotiate with	
				Eartha and have her exchange	
				you for my own son.

talk_Bootie
0x3011	0x98	Bootie		Hey, Nayuta! Look at this star shard!	
0x305c	0x98	Bootie		I got a ton of them at the	
				beach the other day～!	
0x30a5	0x98	ALTO		Oh? Good job.	
0x30d3	0x98	ALTO		(We can still view scenery	
				 from inside star shards.)	
0x312f	0x98	ALTO		(Now that we've separated from Terra,	
				 I wonder if one day we won't be able	
				 to see anything at all...)	
0x31b2	0x98	Bootie		...Hey, you seem kinda down.	
				You should be more surprised!	
0x3202	0x98	ALTO		A-Ahaha, sorry.	
0x3259	0x98	Bootie		Tch, and I finally got to show	
				you my star shard, too...	
0x32b2	0x98	Bootie		...Cheer up a little.	
0x331f	0x98	Bootie		This time, my mom was	
				super worried about me...	
0x336f	0x98	Bootie		This isn't how a man behaves, right?	
				I've gotta be more careful from now on.	
0x33ee	0x98	Bootie		You can't be a man if you keep	
				worrying your mom all the time.	
0x3441	0x98	Bootie		I think I'll sit still	
				at home for a while...	
0x34c9	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, the fact you've been	
				so busy lately has something	
				to do with them, doesn't it? 		
0x3544	0x98	Bootie		...Hmph, you sneaking around	
				like this is a little annoying.	
0x35a3	0x98	Bootie		...Well, good luck with that,	
				Nayuta. For that Kureha girl.	
0x3627	0x98	Bootie		mp_0114 0x35a3
0x3683	0x98	Bootie		And when you come back safe,	
				you'll have plenty of stories	
				to tell me.	
0x3731	0x98	Bootie		I just was collecting star	
				shards on the cape earlier...	
0x378c	0x98	Bootie		A girl with white clothes	
				and silver hair showed up...	
				She picked up a shard for me.	
0x37fd	0x98	Bootie		...Though she didn't say a word,	
				she had such beautiful eyes....	
0x3866	0x98	Bootie		...You know, nevermind.	
				I-I never get nervous	
				around girls, got it!?	
0x38f5	0x98	Bootie		Damn, this is some serious stuff.		
0x3938	0x98	Bootie		I think I'll take a break from	
				collecting star shards for a while.	
0x39c8	0x98	Bootie		Hey Nayuta, what's up with you...?	
0x3a06	0x98	Bootie		...Y-You...perked up	
				for a minute there.	
0x3a46	0x98	Bootie		Well, I'll give you credit	
				where it's due. Rejoice.	
0x3a7b	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3aad	0x98	ALTO		Thanks, Boote... You're kinda
				stubborn, ya know that?	
0x3af8	0x98	Bootie		Shut. it.	
0x3b54	0x98	Bootie		That's the kind of thing	
				Cygna would say.	
0x3baf	0x98	Bootie		...Speaking of which, I haven't	
				seen Cygna around recently.	
				Just what is he even doing?	
0x3c55	0x98	Bootie		I dunno...	
				Eartha collapsed...	
0x3cac	0x98	Bootie		N-Nayuta... Let me give you	
				some of my star shards.	
0x3d05	0x98	Bootie		So, umm...	
				Cheer up...	
0x3d41	0x98	ALTO		...Haha, thanks, Boote.	
				I'll just accept the gesture.	
0x3dc0	0x98	Bootie		Don't be such a prick!	
				It's just...my collection	
				grew too big...	
0x3e1f	0x98	Bootie		It's not like I want to	
				cheer you up or anything.	
0x3eb5	0x98	Bootie		Oh... Nayuta! I didn't	
				know you were back!	
0x3ef5	0x98	ALTO		Hey, Boote.	
				Have you been well?	
0x3f33	0x98	Bootie		Heheh, I, Boote,	
				am ALWAYS well.	
0x3f74	0x98	Bootie		...Don't worry about that.	
				Bring out the gifts already.	
0x3fcc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3ffe	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, just like that...?	
				...Hey, that reminds me.	
0x405a	0x98	ALTO		I was in a rush to board the ferry,	
				so I didn't buy any souvenirs...	
0x40b2	0x98	Bootie		Wh-What!?	
				I asked you to!	
0x40eb	0x98	Bootie		I was so excited for San Ceriz's

				Stupid Nayuta!	
0x416e	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry, sorry.	
				I'll get you one next time.	
0x41c6	0x98	ALTO		(Hmm, he's still as	
				 greedy as ever.)	
0x4242	0x98	Bootie		Forgetting to buy souvenirs...	
				You're really stupid, Nayuta.	
0x429f	0x98	Bootie		Wanna see my new star shards?	
0x42f6	0x98	ALTO		Broken star shards...	
				Looks like you've

0x59f2	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these raised	mp_0000 0xa355

0x5f16	0x98	Keny		With the incident last year, our crops	
				did pretty poorly. But this year we've	
				had an abundant harvest.	
0x5fa8	0x98	Keny		I'm sure the gods are rewarding	
				us with this great harvest.
0x6103	0x98	Keny		Sasha is a pretty chatty one, and	
				can easily deflect your questions.	
0x6152	0x98	Keny		You should probably stay patient	
				and keep on asking her.	
0x61b3	0x98	Keny		I think Sasha from the general store	
				might know where Boote is hiding.	
0x620b	0x98	Keny		However, Sasha is a pretty chatty one,	
				and can easily deflect your questions.	
0x6264	0x98	Keny		Maybe I should have a	mp_0114 0x6152
				more patient conversation	
				with her.	
0x6356	0x98	Keny		Boote just went out.	
0x638b	0x98	Keny		If he returns, I'll contact you.	
				How about going to someone else's	
				place first?	
0x641b	0x98	Keny		Ah, what's the matter, Nayuta?	
0x6453	0x98	ALTO		Umm, is Boote home?	
0x648c	0x98	Keny		Eh, he just went out.	
0x64c2	0x98	Keny		He should be back soon enough...	
				You need him for something?	
0x6522	0x98	ALTO		Umm, you see...	mp_0004 0x14b0f
0x6551	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta told Canie that Dr. Hydrol wanted	
				him to come in for a medical exam.	
0x65b4	0x98	Keny		Oh, I see.	
0x65e3	0x98	Keny		Well, if he returns, I'll contact you.	
				How about going to someone else's	
				place first?	
0x6658	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, I guess I have to.	
				I'll do just that.

0x6880	0x98	Keny		My, it's Nayuta. Boote	
				still isn't home yet.

0x6904	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I-Is that so...?	
				Darn.	
0x6943	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT4	
0x696a	0x98	Keny		Hmm... Come to think of it,	
				he certainly is late coming home.	
0x69c2	0x98	Keny		It's possible that he's...	
				Maybe he's hiding.	
0x6a1a	0x98	Keny		Ah, what's wrong Nayuta?	mp_0114 0x641b
0x6a52	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x6a7c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Umm, didn't	mp_0114 0x6453
				Boote return?	
0x6ab8	0x06	Keny		ANI_NOD	
0x6add	0x98	Keny		Yes, he just went out.	mp_0114 0x648c
0x6b13	0x98	Keny		Though I think he'll return	mp_0114 0x64c2
				before long...	
				What you need with him?	
0x6b73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x6b9d	0x98	ALTO		Umm, you see...	mp_0004 0x14b0f
0x6bcc	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta told Canie that Dr. Hydrol	mp_0114 0x6551
				has come to perform medical exams.	
0x6c2f	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT4	
0x6c56	0x98	Keny		Ah, is that so.	mp_0114 0x65b4
0x6c85	0x98	Keny		In that case, then maybe...	
				Maybe he's hiding.	
0x6cde	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x6d0d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	H-Hiding? Why would he be hiding?	
0x6d4b	0x06	Keny		ANI_TALK	
0x6d71	0x98	Keny		Last time when Dr. Hydrol	
				was here, Boote had a cold.	
0x6dc1	0x98	Keny		So we got him an appointment,	
				and the doctor prescribed him	
				some very bitter medicine.	
0x6e29	0x98	Keny		It's really his own fault though,	
				since he tends to sleep with his 	
				belly exposed...	
0x6e9b	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT0	
0x6ec2	0x98	Keny		I think he's afraid of	
				taking that medicine again,	
				so he ran off somewhere.	
0x6f1e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x6f4c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ahaha... I see.	
0x6f7d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, do you have any	
				idea where he'd be hiding?	
0x6fcb	0x06	Keny		ANI_THINK	
0x6ff2	0x98	Keny		Hmm... Sasha from the	
				general store might know.	
0x704d	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT2	
0x7074	0x98	Keny		Boote seems to frequent the	
				general store to look at the	
				star shards on display.
0x70ed	0x98	Keny		There's a good change he would ask	
				Sasha for help at a time like this.	
0x7156	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x7180	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Okay... Then, I'll	
				try looking there.

0x71f2	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Thank you, Canie.

0x7532	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Um, actually...	
0x7570	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta explained that he was here to pick up the

0x7616	0x98	Keny		Oh, yes, yes, the offerings.

0x7979	0x98	Keny		Ehehe, isn't it amazing?	
				This year was a real bumper crop.	
0x79de	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT3	
0x7a05	0x98	Keny		Last year during the abnormalities,	mp_0114 0x5f16

				This year it was an abundant harvest.	
0x7a97	0x98	Keny		I'm sure the gods are rewarding	mp_0114 0x5fa8
				us with this great harvest.
0x7ae4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_LAUGH	
0x7b0b	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Haha, maybe so.	
0x7b48	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS

0x7cee	0x98	NOI	#6A	With this, it looks like we	mp_0101 0xa690

0x7d6d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x7d92	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, we should bring them	mp_0101 0xa734

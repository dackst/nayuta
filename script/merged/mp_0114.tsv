talk_Keny
0x8bd	0x98	Keny		Though I'm glad I got to meet	
				Noi again...	
				I heard she lost her memory?	
0x922	0x98	Keny		But, there are plenty of	
				fun things in life.	
0x96d	0x98	Keny		You've got to make many	
				memories starting now.	
0x9e2	0x98	Keny		There are plenty of fun	
				things in life.	
0xa28	0x98	Keny		You've got to make many	mp_0114 0x96d
				memories starting now.	
0xaab	0x98	Keny		My, if it isn't Nayuta.	
				You'll be dating Lyra	
				from now on, right?	
0xb0a	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb3c	0x98	ALTO		No, it was just a meeting...	
				Why do you even know	
				about that?	
0xb97	0x98	Keny		Huhu, the wives in the	
				community handle hardship	
0xbe6	0x98	Keny		If it's the center of town,	
				I put in a likely rumor!	
0xc39	0x98	ALTO		A-As expected from the country...	
0xca2	0x98	Keny		Ohoho, do your best	
				on those dates.	
0xce4	0x98	Keny		We'll be cheering for you from	
				the shadow of the blades of grass.	
0xd44	0x98	ALTO		(Good grief...)	
0xda9	0x98	Keny		Though it's a rumor...They say that this	
				strange weather will only get worse.	
0xe15	0x98	Keny		On the continent, they say that many	
				people have collapsed due to Hell	
				Fever...	
0xe82	0x98	Keny		It's a scary story...	
				I wonder just what will happen.	
0xefe	0x98	Keny		No, I can't get scared	
				over a rumor!	
0xf41	0x98	Keny		No matter what happens, we	
				will never lose. We'd be in trouble if	
				housewives couldn't handle hardship!	
0xffb	0x98	Keny		Good grief.	
				This time, I'm going to give him	
				a scolding that's about this much.	
0x1068	0x98	Keny		Even so, that this incident finished	
				without Bootie getting hurt is thanks	
				to Dorado, it seems.	
0x10e5	0x98	Keny		I'll make cookies for him	
				later as thanks.	
0x1156	0x98	Keny		My...It's Nayuta and Noi.	
				Can you put a little more	
				energy in your faces?	
0x11bd	0x98	Keny		Huhu, you must.	
				Though there's various difficulties,	
				we'll do our best together.	
0x1261	0x98	Keny		Somehow it's gloomy outside.	
				The strange weather is continuing.	
0x12bf	0x98	Keny		Since the weather's become like this,	
				the plants suddenly started to wither.	
0x132a	0x98	Keny		Our produce is still fine but...	
				Jessica's production has	
				become bad...	
0x138f	0x98	Keny		Ah, somehow, there's not even one	
				good thing, but... Especially at a time	
				like this, we've got to do our best.	
0x1443	0x98	Keny		Especially at a time like this, we've got	
				to do our best. Shall we prepare the	
				emergency rice?	
0x14bf	0x98	Keny		Because all the men are in a whirl	
				of activity, Eartha and I have to	
				treat everyone to something.	
0x1574	0x98	Keny		Nayuta, don't get too fired up	
				and do something dangerous.	
0x15cd	0x98	Keny		If you got hurt,	
				Eartha would be sad.	
0x1611	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it...	
				I'll absolutely come back safely.	
0x1661	0x98	ALTO		Of course, I'll bring Kureha with me.	
0x16a6	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, that's exactly why you're Nayuta.	
0x1716	0x98	Keny		Anyway, be careful	
				on your way.	
0x1754	0x98	Keny		If you got hurt,	mp_0114 0x15cd
				Eartha would be sad.	
0x17ce	0x98	Keny		Ah, even so,	
				I'm sad...	
0x1804	0x98	Keny		Since I came to Remnant Island to	
				marry, this is the first time the climate	
				has become like this.	
0x1883	0x98	Keny		In Eartha's time too...	
				I'll have to take care that it doesn't	
				disturb Bootie's health.	
0x1920	0x98	Keny		Since I came to Remnant Island to	mp_0114 0x1804
				marry, this is the first time the climate	
				has become like this.	
0x199f	0x98	Keny		In Eartha's time too...	mp_0114 0x1883
				I'll have to take care that it doesn't	
				disturb Bootie's health.	
0x1a30	0x98	Keny		That Kureha's girl's help	
				is very popular all over	
				the island.	
0x1a8c	0x98	Keny		Somehow, she has a good way of speaking.	
				From the start I feel it's dangerous, but	
				she picks up things unexpectedly quickly.	
0x1b26	0x98	Keny		I wonder if she will help with our field again.	
				We're short of hands in harvest season.	
0x1bb6	0x98	Keny		I am told a beautiful girl is	
				staying at your place, Nayuta.	
0x1c11	0x98	Keny		I saw her earlier, and she is	
				a quite graceful girl.	
0x1c64	0x98	Keny		For some reason, she has a noble air	
				about her. She might be the daughter	
				of nobility.	
0x1d0c	0x98	Keny		Ah...I'm relieved.	
				Thank goodness Eartha's	
				illness was cured.	
0x1d67	0x98	Keny		Nayuta, from now on when you're	
				in trouble, tell me everything, OK?	
0x1dc9	0x98	Keny		Because the people of the	
				village are your foster parents.	
0x1e4a	0x98	Keny		Nayuta, from now on when you're	mp_0114 0x1d67
				in trouble, tell me everything, OK?	
0x1eac	0x98	Keny		Because the people of the	mp_0114 0x1dc9
				village are your foster parents.	
0x1f21	0x98	Keny		This is no good...	
				I've got to go visit her.	
0x1f6c	0x98	Keny		Umm, tomatoes and carrots and...	
				Maybe I don't need eggplant...	
0x201a	0x98	Keny		It seems Bootie told Sasha a 	
				lie and hid.	
0x2063	0x98	Keny		Good grief.	
				With this, it's a punishment.	
0x20ab	0x98	Keny		I need to get a prescription for an even more	
				extraordinarily bitter medicine from Dr. Hydol	
				than before.	
0x2162	0x98	Keny		Speaking of that, it's almost time	
				for Dr. Hydol to come to the island.	
0x21c8	0x98	Keny		The doctor coming to the island	
				really helps us a lot～.	
0x221f	0x98	Keny		If any of us come down with a cold,	
				we can't easily go to the Saint	
				Cerize medical clinic.	
0x22a1	0x98	Keny		It looks like Dr. Hydol has come.	
0x22e2	0x98	Keny		Huhu, he always supports us,	
				and I should share some of	
				our vegetables with him.	
0x23a6	0x98	Keny		I suddenly received a present	
				and don't know what to think...	
				With this, I'm genuinely happy.	
0x2421	0x98	Keny		The one who picked out this flower for	
				me was you, Nayuta, wasn't it?	
				Huhu, I must thank you, too.	
0x24ab	0x98	Keny		I suddenly received a present	
				and don't know what to think...	
0x2507	0x98	Keny		I still worried that the other day	
				was our wedding anniversary.	
0x2565	0x98	Keny		Huhu, that's very like	
				my husband.	
0x25e2	0x98	Keny		If it is our Bootie,	
				he went to play in	
				the new ruins that fell.	
0x2640	0x98	Keny		He said he was collecting "Star Shards."	
				Huhu, he hasn't lost interest in that.	
0x26ae	0x98	Keny		Well, if it is those pretty stones,	
				wanting to collect them can't	
				be helped.	
0x2740	0x98	Keny		If I remember correctly, you collect	
				"Star Shards" too, don't you.	
0x27a1	0x98	Keny		Well, if it is those pretty stones,	mp_0114 0x26ae
				wanting to collect them can't	
				be helped.	
0x2841	0x98	Keny		I was surprised...	
				That was ruins falling	
				just now, wasn't it?	
0x289d	0x98	Keny		Though our Bootie left,	
				you're going to look at	
				it now too, right?	
0x28fd	0x98	Keny		Huhu, though I can't stop you,	
				be careful on your way.	
0x297a	0x98	Keny		If it was small rubble that fell,	
				I'm used to it, but...	
0x29d1	0x98	Keny		Good grief.	
				Cleaning them up is troublesome.	
0x2a52	0x98	Keny		My, if it isn't Nayuta!	
				It's been awhile!	
0x2a9a	0x98	ALTO		Good day, Canie...	
0x2acc	0x98	Keny		Shut up!!	
0x2af5	0x98	Keny		It's M-r-s. C-a-n-i-e.	
				...Got it?	
0x2b35	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2b67	0x98	ALTO		...Good day, Mrs. Canie.	
0x2b9f	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, very good!	
0x2bd0	0x98	Keny		While you are here,	
				will you still play with	
				my Bootie?	
0x2c25	0x98	Keny		He's been pretty sad during	
				the time you were away.	
0x2c77	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, is that so.	
				Got it, Can──	
0x2cb8	0x98	Keny		Hmm? (smile)	
0x2ce4	0x98	ALTO		...M-Mrs. Canie.	
0x2d4e	0x98	Keny		Huhu, you're cute as	
				ever, Nayuta.	
0x2d8f	0x98	Keny		And...I heard you started	
				the Handyman Shop	
				with Cygna?	
0x2de4	0x98	Keny		Ahaha, you're so full of energy!	
				I think I'll ask you to help	
				with the field work again～.	
0x2e5c	0x98	ALTO		Hahaha, I look forward to it.	
				Can...Mrs. Canie.	
0x2ed2	0x98	Keny		Both you and Cygna,	
				you're both energetic and	
				straightforward. How nice.	
0x2f38	0x98	Keny		I wonder if I'll discuss with	
				Eartha and exchange my	
				kid for you.	
0x2f97	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
talk_Bootie
0x3011	0x98	Bootie		Hey, Nayuta!	
				Come look at this Star Shard!	
0x305c	0x98	Bootie		The other day, I got a ton	
				in the sea～.	
0x30a5	0x98	ALTO		Oh? Well done.	
0x30d3	0x98	ALTO		(The scene inside the Star Shard	
				 is one I haven't yet seen.)	
0x312f	0x98	ALTO		(Now that I'm separated from <Terra>,	
				 I wonder if the day when I can	
				 no longer see it will come...)	
0x31b2	0x98	Bootie		...Hey, you seem kinda down.	
				Be more surprised!	
0x3202	0x98	ALTO		A-Ahaha, sorry.	
0x3259	0x98	Bootie		Tch, and I especially let you	
				see the Star Shard, too...	
0x32b2	0x98	Bootie		...Cheer up a little.	
0x331f	0x98	Bootie		This time, my mom was	
				super worried about me...	
0x336f	0x98	Bootie		Like this, I'm not a man.	
				I'll be careful from now on.	
0x33ee	0x98	Bootie		Because I'm always worrying	
				my mom, I'm not a man.	
0x3441	0x98	Bootie		As expected, I'll sit still	
				at home for awhile...	
0x34c9	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, you being busy lately and	
				those guys, as I thought, are they	
				connected in some way?	
0x3544	0x98	Bootie		...Hmph, you keeping secrets	
				like this is a little irritating.	
0x35a3	0x98	Bootie		...Well, do your best, Nayuta.	
				For that girl called Kureha.	
0x3627	0x98	Bootie		...Well, do your best, Nayuta.	mp_0114 0x35a3
				For that girl called Kureha.	
0x3683	0x98	Bootie		And, if you come back safe,	
				I'll ask you about various	
				things.	
0x3731	0x98	Bootie		Until just now I was collecting	
				Star Shards on the cape...	
0x378c	0x98	Bootie		A girl with white clothes and	
				silver hair came...	
				She collected one shard for me.	
0x37fd	0x98	Bootie		...Though I didn't say anything,	
				she found this beautiful colored one...	
0x3866	0x98	Bootie		...Well, nevermind.	
				I've no reason to get excited	
				over girls, you know!	
0x38f5	0x98	Bootie		Damn, this is humiliating	
				somehow.	
0x3938	0x98	Bootie		I'll take a break from collecting	
				Star Shards for awhile.	
0x39c8	0x98	Bootie		Hey Nayuta, lately you're...	
0x3a06	0x98	Bootie		...Y-You're making	
				a good face.	
0x3a46	0x98	Bootie		Good work.	
				I'm glad.	
0x3a7b	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3aad	0x98	ALTO		Thanks Bootie.	
				...But somehow, you're stiff?	
0x3af8	0x98	Bootie		Y-You're annoying.	
0x3b54	0x98	Bootie		The truth is, big brother Cygna	
				would say stuff like that.	
0x3baf	0x98	Bootie		...Speaking of that, I haven't seen	
				big brother Cygna. I wonder what	
				he's doing.	
0x3c55	0x98	Bootie		I don't really get it but,	
				Eartha suddenly	
				collapsed...	
0x3cac	0x98	Bootie		N-Nayuta...	
				I'll share some of my	
				"Star Shards" with you.	
0x3d05	0x98	Bootie		Because, umm...	
				Cheer up...	
0x3d41	0x98	ALTO		...Ahaha, thanks Bootie.	
				I'll accept just your feelings.	
0x3dc0	0x98	Bootie		Y-You're mistaken.	
				It's because...my collection	
				grew too big...	
0x3e1f	0x98	Bootie		It's not to cheer you	
				up or anything.	
0x3eb5	0x98	Bootie		Ah...Nayuta!	
				Have you returned?	
0x3ef5	0x98	ALTO		Hey Bootie.	
				Have you been well?	
0x3f33	0x98	Bootie		Huhu, I, Bootie,	
				am ALWAYS well.	
0x3f74	0x98	Bootie		...More importantly, look here.	
				It's a present for you.	
0x3fcc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3ffe	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, doing that all of a sudden...	
				...Hey, that reminds me.	
0x405a	0x98	ALTO		I hurried to board the ferry and	
				didn't buy a souvenir...	
0x40b2	0x98	Bootie		W-What!?	
				I asked you to!	
0x40eb	0x98	Bootie		It's Saint Cerize's famous product,	
				"Harbor Souffle." I was looking forward	
				to it... Stupid Nayuta!	
0x416e	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry, sorry.	
				I'll definitely buy it for you next time.	
0x41c6	0x98	ALTO		(Hmm, he's as gluttonous	
				 as ever.)	
0x4242	0x98	Bootie		Forgetting to buy souvenirs...	
				You're really stupid, Nayuta.	
0x429f	0x98	Bootie		Should I let you see my newly	
				collected "Star Shards?"	
0x42f6	0x98	ALTO		Plain "Star Shards"...	
				It seems you've collected	
				quite a few.	
0x4351	0x98	ALTO		(It seems there are more here	
				 than are in my room...	
				 I've got to get him to show me♪)	
0x43ef	0x98	Bootie		Forgetting to buy souvenirs...	mp_0114 0x4242
				You're really stupid, Nayuta.	
0x444c	0x98	Bootie		Should I let you see my newly	mp_0114 0x429f
				collected "Star Shards?"	
talk_Sculp
0x453d	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta,	mp_0000 0x7935
				I've got something I want you to hear.	
0x4590	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	mp_0000 0x7988
				What in the world is it?	
0x45d3	0x98	Sculp		The truth is, I heard this story	mp_0000 0x79cb
				from Antlia recently...	
0x462b	0x98	Sculp		It seems using fertile "soils"	mp_0000 0x7a23
				will improve crops greatly.	
0x4685	0x98	Sculp		It's better than manure, and	mp_0000 0x7a7d
				it's pretty popular on the continent.	
0x46e7	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	mp_0000 0x7adf
				I can't find much good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x475f	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, eh?	mp_0000 0x7b57
				I don't think I have any	
				good ideas.	
0x47b8	0x98	ALTO		From the start, Remnant Island soil	mp_0000 0x7bb0
				is full of salt and hard, probably...	
0x4820	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	mp_0000 0x7c18
				It's probably as you say.	
0x487d	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems I heard an	mp_0000 0x7c75
				impossible story, eh? Sorry,	
				my bad.	
0x48da	0x98	Sculp		But if you get some good "soil"	mp_0000 0x7cd2
				somewhere, I'd be a help	
				if you could give me some.	
0x494c	0x98	Sculp		Will you keep that in mind	mp_0000 0x7d44
				for me?	
0x498e	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x49bb	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile "soil," was it?	mp_0000 0x7db3
				 If I find some, I should try	
				 bringing it to Sculp, right?)	
0x4b12	0x98	Sculp		If those guys come again,	
				I've got to at least protect my family.	
0x4b73	0x98	Sculp		You've got to save	
				Kureha somehow, too.	
0x4bba	0x98	Sculp		That's the duty of a man...	
				That's your duty.	
0x4c2f	0x98	Sculp		This wound I got from those guys hurts...	
				I must absolutely protect my family.	
0x4c9d	0x98	Sculp		You've got to save	mp_0114 0x4b73
				Kureha somehow, too.	
0x4d00	0x98	Sculp		This rose that does not wither...	
				It seems Canie loves it.	
0x4d5a	0x98	Sculp		Thanks, Nayuta.	
				I can't say thanks enough.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x4df0	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good "soil!?"	
0x4e44	0x98	Sculp		It is dark, has a soft feel and has a fragrant	mp_0000 0x97a3
				earthy scent... There's no mistake- It is	
				of excellent quality.	
0x4ed1	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, the truth is, I found it	mp_0000 0x9830
				someplace...	
0x4f1b	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's alright with you,	mp_0112 0x10b83
				can I give it to you?	
0x4fa6	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	mp_0000 0x9907
0x4fdb	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	mp_0000 0x993c
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x5056	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha of the general	mp_0000 0x99b7
				store came to tell me she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x50d0	0x98	Sculp		Because she said she wants to stock	mp_0000 0x9a31
				my vegetables, I'm honored by the request	
				and I thought I would respond to it somehow.	
0x5169	0x98	Sculp		Anyhow, you helped me out, Nayuta.	mp_0000 0x9aca
				Please use this well for me.	
0x51c8	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	mp_0000 0x9b29
0x5205	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	mp_0000 0x9b66
				I won't hesitate to tell you.	
0x525d	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	mp_0000 0x9bbe
				I'll look forward to then, Nayuta.

				It looks like you again have

0x54a5	0x98	Sculp		If it's alright with you, please give it here.	mp_0112 0x1110d

0x5529	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	mp_0000 0x9e8c

0x55a1	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this too is very fertile.	mp_0000 0x9f04

0x5794	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's of unthinkably	mp_0000 0xa0f7

0x5819	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, various things happened.	mp_0000 0xa17c

0x5f16	0x98	Keny		Last year during the abnormalities,	
				no matter what we did, our crops suffered.	
				This year it was an abundant harvest.	
0x5fa8	0x98	Keny		I wonder if god is giving this to us	
				as a reward.	
0x6103	0x98	Keny		Sasha is pretty easily influenced	
				and evaded us.	
0x6152	0x98	Keny		Maybe I should have a	
				more patient conversation	
				with her.	
0x61b3	0x98	Keny		The general store's Sasha	
				may know where Bootie	
				is hiding.	
0x620b	0x98	Keny		However, Sasha is pretty easily	
				influenced, and evaded us.	
0x6264	0x98	Keny		Maybe I should have a	mp_0114 0x6152
				more patient conversation	
				with her.	
0x6356	0x98	Keny		Bootie just went out.	
0x638b	0x98	Keny		If he returns I'll contact you,	
				so how about going to where	
				someone else is?	
0x641b	0x98	Keny		Ah, what's wrong Nayuta?	
0x6453	0x98	ALTO		Umm, didn't	
				Bootie return?	
0x648c	0x98	Keny		Yes, he just went out.	
0x64c2	0x98	Keny		Though I think he'll return	
				before long...	
				What you need with him?	
0x6522	0x98	ALTO		Umm, you see...	mp_0004 0x14b0f
0x6551	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta told Canie that Dr. Hydol	
				has come to perform medical exams.	
0x65b4	0x98	Keny		Ah, is that so.	
0x65e3	0x98	Keny		Then, if he returns, I'll contact you.	
				How about going ahead to where	
				other people are?	
0x6658	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, it can't be helped.	
				I'll do that.

0x696a	0x98	Keny		Hmm...

0x69c2	0x98	Keny		It's possible that he is...

0x6c56	0x98	Keny		Ah, is that so.	mp_0114 0x65b4

0x6d71	0x98	Keny		Last time when Dr. Hydol came,	
				Bootie had a cold.	
0x6dc1	0x98	Keny		When we took him to the doctor,	
				he had him take some very	
				bitter medicine.	
0x6e29	0x98	Keny		It's really his own fault though,	
				since he tends to sleep with his 	
				belly exposed...	
0x6e9b	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT0	
0x6ec2	0x98	Keny		When he thought of taking that

0x6fcb	0x06	Keny		ANI_THINK	
0x6ff2	0x98	Keny		Hmm...It's possible that

				may know.	
0x704d	0x06	Keny		ANI_WAIT2	
0x7074	0x98	Keny		She moves the <Star Shards> that	
				she decorates the shop with from	
				place to place, it seems.	
0x70ed	0x98	Keny		The possibility is high that Bootie	
				asked her for help at a time like	
				this.

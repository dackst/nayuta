talk_Puppis
0x598	0x98	Puppis		This strange cooling somehow seems	
				related to the entire Ciencia Sea.	
0x5fe	0x98	Puppis		This situation will cause a panic	
				no matter which island you go to.	
0x662	0x98	Puppis		I'm supposed to be going to	
				Saint Cerize around this time...	
0x6bf	0x98	Puppis		...Sorry.	
				I wasn't about to.	
0x724	0x98	Puppis		I don't know the details, but...	
				It doesn't seem like the strange	
				weather is just around here.	
0x7a2	0x98	Puppis		I don't know how far	
				it extends out...	
talk_Puppis_and_Axe
0x8db	0x98	Puppis		...Hey, boy.	
				Various troubling things happened.	
0x92b	0x98	ALTO		Captain...You're safe.	
0x961	0x98	Puppis		Those strange guys attacked	
				while I was in the middle of landing,	
				but I was able to take shelter.	
0x9e2	0x98	Puppis		All of the sailors are fine too.	
0xa24	0x98	Axe		I looked with him, and it seems	
				the boat and the ship are undamaged.	
				There won't be any trouble putting to sea.	
0xab0	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...thank goodness.	
				It looks like there are no	
				serious injuries.	
0xb17	0x98	Puppis		Yeah, those guys weren't	
				after that sort of thing.	
0xb6a	0x98	Puppis		...Well boy, I won't say that	
				line again, but...	
0xbbb	0x98	ALTO		...............	mp_0001 0xc917
0xbea	0x98	Puppis		I heard the story, but...	
				it seems you don't have	
				much fighting spirit.	
0xc51	0x98	Puppis		You've got to take	
				responsibility yourself.	
talk_Crux
0xd76	0x98	Crux		Me and the Captain were	
				just landing...	
				We took refuge in the museum.	
0xdd9	0x98	Crux		Ooh, what is with	
				those armored guys!?	
0xe1e	0x98	Crux		We're resentful	
				of you, damn!	
0xe82	0x98	Crux		What's more, the weather in this area	
				isn't clearing up at all.	
0xee0	0x98	Crux		It continues forever offshore...	
				Can the ship leave like this?	
talk_Axe
0xfc1	0x98	Axe		...Say, how is the sea?	
				If I think about the worst...	
0x1014	0x98	Puppis		Yeah, somehow, it seems the entire	
				Ciencia Sea is cooling down.	
0x1074	0x98	Puppis		I don't know about other islands,	
				but they should be panicking.	
0x10d4	0x98	Puppis		...Good grief, it seems we can't	
				leave with our usual carefree	
				preparations.	
0x1168	0x98	Axe		Anyhow, I'm glad the ship's safe.	
0x11a8	0x98	Axe		But, we don't know a single thing	
				about those weird guys...	
				You be careful too, Captain.	
talk_Carina
0x124b	0x98	Carina		I'm thankful that Kureha saved	
				Collie, Vel and Axe.	
0x129f	0x98	Carina		Nayuta...	
				I'm sure you'll save her.	
0x12ed	0x98	Carina		That these kind of scary things	
				would occur on the island is	
				unexpected...	
0x1357	0x98	Carina		But, thank goodness Collie,	
				Vel and Axe are safe.	
0x13a9	0x98	Carina		...This is because Kureha	
				protected all of us.	
0x13f8	0x98	Carina		Nayuta...	mp_0003d 0x129f
				I'm sure you'll save her.

talk_Puppis
0x598	0x98	Puppis		This crazy cold spell apparently extends	
				throughout the entire Ciencia Sea.	
0x5fe	0x98	Puppis		From the way things look,	
				every island must be in a	
				state of panic right now.	
0x662	0x98	Puppis		I'm sure Saint Cerise is going	
				through the same thing....	
0x6bf	0x98	Puppis		...Damn it, this is not good.`
				The world's not in a good	
				place at the moment.	
0x724	0x98	Puppis		I don't know the specifics,	
				but...this crazy weather isn't	
				only happening around here.	
0x7a2	0x98	Puppis		We don't know how far it goes...	
talk_Puppis_and_Axe
0x8db	0x98	Puppis		...Hey, boy. This whole situation	
				is a mess right now, huh?	
0x92b	0x98	ALTO		Captain... I'm glad you're okay.
0x961	0x98	Puppis		Those lunatics attacked while I	
				was in the middle of landing, but	
				luckily, I was able to find shelter.	
0x9e2	0x98	Puppis		All the sailors on board are fine, too.	
0xa24	0x98	Axe		I just checked it out with him, and it looks	
				like the boat and the ship are unharmed.	
				They shouldn't have any problems sailing.	
0xab0	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...? Phew.	
				Seems like no one was	
				seriously injured.	
0xb17	0x98	Puppis		Yeah, I figure they were after	
				something more specific.	
0xb6a	0x98	Puppis		...Oops, well, I guess that wasn't	
				the best thing to say to the boy...	
0xbbb	0x98	ALTO		...............	mp_0001 0xc917
0xbea	0x98	Puppis		I only heard what happened	
				secondhand, but...don't get	
				yourself too worked up about it.	
0xc51	0x98	Puppis		You're not to blame	
				for any of this, boy.	
talk_Crux
0xd76	0x98	Crux		Me and the captain were just	
				landing before we had to run	
				away into some museum...	
0xdd9	0x98	Crux		Ooh, what is with	
				those armored guys!?	
0xe1e	0x98	Crux		Dammit, you got a problem with us!?	
0xe82	0x98	Crux		What's more, the terrible weather	
				in this area isn't clearing up at all.	
0xee0	0x98	Crux		It just goes on and on into the sea...	
				Can the ship even sail like this?	
talk_Axe
0xfc1	0x98	Axe		...Say, how is the sea doing?	
				I didn't think this was possible...	
0x1014	0x98	Puppis		Yeah, apparently this crazy cold	
				spell is happening throughout	
				the entire Ciencia sea.	
0x1074	0x98	Puppis		I haven't been to the other	
				islands, but I'm sure everyone's	
				in a state of panic right now.
0x10d4	0x98	Puppis		...Oh man, we'll have to get the	
				ship ready. Looks like it won't	
				be smooth sailing as usual.	
0x1168	0x98	Axe		Well, I'm just glad the ship's safe.	
0x11a8	0x98	Axe		But still, we don't know what	
				was up with those freaks...	
				You be careful too, Captain.	
talk_Carina
0x124b	0x98	Carina		I have to thank Kureha for	
				saving Collie, Vel, and Axe.	
0x129f	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, you...
				You have to rescue her.	
0x12ed	0x98	Carina		I can't believe something	
				so horrible could happen	
				on this island...	
0x1357	0x98	Carina		But I'm so glad Collie,	
				Vel, and Axe are safe...	
0x13a9	0x98	Carina		...This is all because
				Kureha protected us.	
0x13f8	0x98	Carina		Nayuta...	mp_0003d 0x129f
				I'm sure you'll save her.

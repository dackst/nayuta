0x33ca	0x98	Algorl		If the four wardens pool their strength,	
				then possibly...	
0x3424	0x98	Algorl		However, the teachings of Kureha and	
				the others are simply a treasure.	
				...Entrusted to us.	
0x34d2	0x98	Algorl		It seems the situation is in chaos...	
0x3519	0x98	Algorl		However, that Kureha was kidnapped	
				is reality. It's only natural that you	
				would chase her.	
0x3593	0x98	Algorl		We will support you as much as we can.	
				...Now, you should hurry ahead.	
0x3622	0x98	Algorl		At a time like this,	
				there's no mistake that Zext plans	
				to use Kureha for something...	
0x3698	0x98	Algorl		Hurry ahead, you two.	
0x370b	0x98	Algorl		This magic is a fragment of	
				my power that I have given to Noi.	
				...Use it freely.	
0x377b	0x98	Algorl		Beyond this point, countless trials

0x37e4	0x98	Algorl		For Terra, and for Master Kureha...	
				Please take care of them.	
0x3866	0x98	Algorl		Hmm...as expected, you have come	
				to this temple once again.	
0x38c2	0x98	Algorl		While I couldn't move,	
				it seems this place got worse	
				by the moment.

0x3e6e	0x98	Algorl		So you have safely found	
				Nemeas' spirit...	
0x3eb9	0x98	Algorl		Hmm, it seems that a now relaxed	
				presence is heading for Nemeas' location.	
0x3f24	0x98	Algorl		If the spirits return,	
				Nemeas will be pleased.	
				For that, I give my thanks.	
0x3f98	0x98	Algorl		As for the presence of Nemeas' spirit,	
				it is near the "Wind-Cutting Valley" in the	
				southwest part of Heimmel.	
0x4025	0x98	Algorl		It would be good to search in the	
				"Autumn" season.	
0x4078	0x98	Algorl		Because the presence is considerably	
				panicked, you should go quickly.	
0x41cb	0x98	Algorl		The fragments of my lost power	
				should be in the shape of faint light	
				balls floating above the origin continent.	
0x425a	0x98	Algorl		Furthermore, as you collect the power,	
				light should steadily return to the jewel.	
0x42cc	0x98	Algorl		Once the jewel reaches maximum brightness,	
				I want you to bring it here once more.

0x45ee	0x98	Algorl		...Noi and Nayuta, is it?	
0x4629	0x98	Algorl		There is something that

0x4b56	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yes, of course

0x4bbe	0x98	Algorl		...Is that so. I thank you.	
0x4c1b	0x98	Algorl		As for the request I have for you...	
				it is regarding my sealed power.	
0x4c81	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x4caa	0x98	NOI	#6A	Sealed power...?	
0x4cf3	0x98	Algorl		You should know about this Noi...	
				Among us wardens is endowed great	
				power to be used in times of crisis.	
0x4d7b	0x98	Algorl		With the number of monsters,	
				and of course opposing the Mythos,	
				it is easy to fall behind.	
0x4df5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x4e1d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Certainly, even when you were trapped,	
				I could sense a great power from you.	
0x4e8b	0x98	NOI	#6A	Algol is normally calm,	
				but when he get serious, he can	
				even blow up mountains.	
0x4f1a	0x98	Algorl		Hmm, but...	
				Since I was released from the seal,	
				I've recovered only part of my power.	
0x4f8f	0x98	Algorl		...Somehow, it seems Master Selam	
				created a double seal.	
0x4fe8	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x5012	0x98	ALTO	#6A	A double seal!?	
0x5044	0x06	NOI		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x506d	0x98	NOI	#6A	He did something to you	
				in addition to the barrier!?	
0x50c2	0x98	Algorl		Hmm...	
				It seems my power was split into three,	
				sealed, and scattered about.	
0x512d	0x98	Algorl		And what's more, they are not on this continent,	
				but were transferred to another continent.	
0x51a9	0x98	Algorl		I am concerned about this...	
				My power now is half of what	
				it originally was.	
0x5215	0x98	Algorl		If you spend time on it, it seems	
				you can steadily recover my power...	
				It will take considerable time.	
0x529b	0x06	NOI		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x52c4	0x98	NOI	#6A	No way...	mp_0100 0x1c977
0x52ef	0x98	NOI	#6A	If a time came when we couldn't	
				rely on your power, it'd be big trouble!	
0x536f	0x98	Algorl		I too feel the current situation is truly regrettable.	
0x53e7	0x98	Algorl		Now...I want to receive your help	
				to quickly recover my lost power.	
0x544b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x5475	0x98	ALTO	#6A	We would be glad to be	
				of help to you, but...	
0x54c4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What specifically should we do?	
0x551e	0x98	Algorl		First, I want you to take this.	
0x5585	0x06	Algorl		ANI_HANDOVER	
0x55b9	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558
0x568e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x56b8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	This is...?	
				Somehow, it is ashen	
				and dull.	
0x5703	0x98	Algorl		That is a special jewel that	
				can contain my power as	
				a warden.	
0x5761	0x98	Algorl		Holding that, I want you to	
				collect my scattered power.	
0x57fb	0x98	Algorl		As for the place my power is sealed in,	
				according to the spirits, it is in	
				La Worg, the origin continent, it seems.	
0x5890	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x58b9	0x98	NOI	#6A	La Worg...

0x597a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x59a4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Speaking of your power, Algol,	
				how should we search for it?	
0x5a01	0x98	Algorl		My powers will likely be in the shape	
				of floating light balls.	
0x5a60	0x98	Algorl		If you find one and hold that jewel to it,	
				the jewel will be able to absorb the power.	
0x5ad7	0x98	Algorl		Furthermore, as you collect the power,	mp_3099 0x425a
				light should steadily return to the jewel.	
0x5b49	0x98	Algorl		Once the jewel reaches maximum brightness,	mp_3099 0x42cc
				I want you to bring it here once more.	
0x5bbb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x5be3	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see...I understand.	
0x5c30	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Well then, Noi.

0x5ca4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x5d02	0x98	NOI	#6A	Just wait, Algol!

0x172e	0x98	Gio		So Nemeas has granted you power.	
				That's great. It looks as if you can proceed now.	
0x17a9	0x98	Gio		Now that you have Nemeas' power,	
				it looks as if you can proceed.	
0x17fd	0x98	Gio		Leave this place to me. You should	
				climb Heliograd!	
0x1884	0x98	Gio		Because each continent's temple was	
				stopped, it seems the Power of Stars	
				is flowing into Heliograd.	
0x1909	0x98	Gio		It seems that's man's objective was this...	
0x1953	0x98	Gio		Anyhow, I will try searching for a method	
				to stop the flow of power.	
0x19b5	0x98	Gio		You should save Nemeas!	
0x1a13	0x98	Gio		From our temples, we will try	
				searching for a way to stop Power of Stars	
				flowing into the tower.	
0x1a92	0x98	Gio		You should save Nemeas!	mp_1099 0x19b5
0x1b18	0x98	Gio		Hmm, hmm, it seems you have	
				safely rescued Algol.	
0x1b71	0x98	Gio		It seems that Algol, too, has been	
				safely released from his cage.	
0x1bcb	0x98	Gio		Three wardens have	
				now been assembled.	
0x1c16	0x98	Gio		Remaining is the warden who oversees the Origin Continent...	
				If we had her help, we would be able to restore	
				order to the entire system...	
0x1ce0	0x98	Gio		The remaining warden is, even among us,	
				a person given outstanding knowledge	
				and wisdom.	
0x1d55	0x98	Gio		If you assemble them, our entire	
				order will have been assembled...	
0x1dd1	0x98	Gio		It seems like Master Kureha's	
				memory has not yet returned.	
0x1e24	0x98	Gio		It cannot be helped...	
				In the end, she has been sleeping	
				too long as a Mythos.	
0x1e91	0x98	Gio		Hmm...changing the environment	
				and experiencing new things	
				may have some meaning.	
0x1f32	0x98	Gio		As expected, I'm surprised	
				that Master Kureha has	
				awakened.	
0x1f8a	0x98	Gio		If I have time, I should	
				visit to greet her.	
0x1fd4	0x6B	Gio		Ellipsis	
0x2005	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x202f	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x2060	0x98	NOI		What's wrong,	
				so deep in thought like that...	
0x20ab	0x98	Gio		...No, I was just thinking that	
				too many things have happened.	
0x2107	0x98	Gio		Everything is because of the	
				crimes committed by Zext...	
0x215d	0x98	Gio		Or perhaps, awakening Master Kureha	
				was part of his plan.	
0x21b4	0x98	ALTO		No way...	mp_0100 0x1c977
0x21dd	0x98	Gio		In the end it is only a guess...	
				You two should be careful.	
0x2270	0x98	Gio		Come to think of it, it seems	
				you are searching for something.	
0x22cc	0x98	Gio		If you are going to the sacred mountain	
				continent, take care on your way.	
0x2333	0x98	Gio		The same as Oltapia and Rieseweld,	
				I sense the climate is very disturbed.	
				Make careful preparations.	
0x23dc	0x98	Gio		If you are going to the sacred mountain	mp_1099 0x22cc
				continent, take care on your way.	
0x2443	0x98	Gio		The same as Oltapia and Rieseweld,	mp_1099 0x2333
				I sense the climate is very disturbed.	
				Make careful preparations.	
0x2500	0x98	Gio		My interest in the lifestyle of humans	
				has been skillfully deepened thanks to you.	
				Allow me to thank you.	
0x2586	0x98	Gio		For this world too, you two	
				have done much for me.	
0x25d6	0x98	Gio		Nayuta, I look forward to	
				working with you from here on.	
0x2650	0x98	Gio		I do not know if that man calling himself Zext	
				is really the leader of the Mythos race that	
				created this world of Terra, but...	
0x26ec	0x98	Gio		There's no mistake about his	
				abilities that captured me or his	
				manipulation of the Master Gears.	
0x276b	0x98	Gio		As an existence that threatens Terra,	
				as a warden, I cannot allow him to pass.	
0x27d9	0x98	Gio		I will need your help at some point.	
				Thank you in advance for your help.	
0x2859	0x98	ALTO		Yes, same here.	
0x2888	0x98	ALTO		...By the way, I've been interested in it	
				for a while but, what are those things	
				flying about?	
0x2903	0x98	NOI		Those are Gio's "spirits."	
0x293c	0x98	Gio		They are spiritual life forms brought	
				forth by the great Power of Stars	
				that the continent possesses.	
0x29c0	0x98	Gio		Though they cannot speak,	
				the are very hardworking and are	
				always helping me with various things.	
0x2a3e	0x98	ALTO		I-I see...	
				(This is truly a strange world...)	
0x2ad2	0x98	Gio		But, because I was stopped once,	
				this temple is not in good shape.	
0x2b32	0x98	Gio		It is because you retrieved the	
				Master Gear that we were able	
				to avoid the worst outcome, but...	
0x2bb1	0x98	Gio		It seems it will take time for	
				the continent to return to normal.

0x30c9	0x98	Gio		Oh, it looks like you found	
				Nemeas' spirits safely.	
0x311a	0x98	Gio		Hmm, to be caught in the swamp is...	
				It's quite rare for such a thing to happen	
				to spirits, who live in harmony with nature.	
0x31b3	0x98	Gio		I do not know your reason,	
				but it seems you are in a hurry.	
0x3216	0x98	Gio		I feel the presence of Nemeas' spirits near the	
				forest called "Hermit's Path of Abundant Harvest"	
				in the midwest of Oltapia.	
0x32af	0x98	Gio		You should change the season	
				to "Summer" and search there.	
0x3307	0x98	Gio		Somehow, I sense the presence of	
				considerable confusion. It would be	
				good to save them.	
0x33d9	0x98	Gio		Oh, it seems you successfully	
				found the Byakuda Tree.	
				As I expected from you, Nayuta.	
0x344b	0x98	Gio		I trust there's someone	
				waiting for it, no?	
				You should hurry.	
0x34c7	0x98	Gio		The Byakuda Tree grows	
				in "Summer" of Heimmel.	
0x3513	0x98	Gio		If you search in "Wind-Cutting Valley,"	
				you should find a pretty big one.	
0x357a	0x98	Gio		If you use its scent,	
				those two should calm down	
				and be able to speak.	
0x36ba	0x98	Gio		Whether it's local cuisine, or a special	
				tree fruit, or anything at all, it will be fine.	
				I'll leave it to your judgment, Nayuta.	
0x3758	0x98	Gio		Gather three things and	
				bring them here.	
0x379e	0x98	Gio		Good luck then.	
QS_24_quest_start
0x39c7	0x98	Gio		Yes, then I'd like you

0x3a12	0x98	Gio		There are other circumstances?

0x3a7e	0x98	Gio		Oh, I was waiting for you,	
				Nayuta and Noi.	
0x3ac6	0x98	Gio		With that expression,

0x3c88	0x98	Gio		Hehe, a while back, I	
				searched for a place

0x3ce9	0x98	Gio		Aiming for that place,	
				I sent the letter with

0x1ac32	0x40	Signa	#0W	"Cygna" and "Selam" each

0x172e	0x98	Gio		So Nemeas has granted you power. That's great. 	
				It looks as if you can proceed now.	
0x17a9	0x98	Gio		Now that you have Nemeas' power,	
				it looks as if you can proceed.	
0x17fd	0x98	Gio		Leave this place to me.	
				You should climb Heliograd!	
0x1884	0x98	Gio		Because each continent's Temple was	
				stopped, it seems that all the Power	
				of Stars is flowing into Heliograd.	
0x1909	0x98	Gio		So this was his true objective...	
0x1953	0x98	Gio		Anyhow, I will try looking for a	
				way to stop the flow of power.	
0x19b5	0x98	Gio		You should save Nemeas!	
0x1a13	0x98	Gio		From our Temples, we will try looking	
				for a way to stop the Power of Stars	
				from flowing into the tower.	
0x1a92	0x98	Gio		You should save Nemeas!	mp_1099 0x19b5
0x1b18	0x98	Gio		Mmhmm, it seems that you have	
				safely rescued Algol.	
0x1b71	0x98	Gio		Now Algol, too, has been	
				released from his prison.	
0x1bcb	0x98	Gio		Three Wardens have	
				now been assembled.	
0x1c16	0x98	Gio		Remaining is the Warden of the Origin Continent...	
				Once she is free, we will be ready for anything...	
0x1ce0	0x98	Gio		The remaining Warden has more knowledge	
				and wisdom than any of us.	
0x1d55	0x98	Gio		Once she is free, we will	
				be ready for anything...	
0x1dd1	0x98	Gio		It seems like Lady Creha's	
				memory has not yet returned.	
0x1e24	0x98	Gio		There is no helping it given	
				that the last of the Mitos	
				has slept for so long.	
0x1e91	0x98	Gio		Hmm... The changing environment	
				and new abnormalities may have	
				some meaning.	
0x1f32	0x98	Gio		It's good to hear	
				that Lady Creha	
				has awakened.	
0x1f8a	0x98	Gio		When I get the chance, I should	
				stop by for a visit and say hello.	
0x1fd4	0x6B	Gio		Ellipsis	
0x2005	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x202f	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x2060	0x98	NOI		What's the matter?	
				You look deep in thought...	
0x20ab	0x98	Gio		...Well, I was just thinking that	
				so many things have happened.	
0x2107	0x98	Gio		All because of Zext
				and his evil work...		
0x215d	0x98	Gio		Even awakening Lady Creha...	
				Perhaps it was part of his plan.	
0x21b4	0x98	ALTO		No way...	mp_0100 0x1c977
0x21dd	0x98	Gio		It is only a guess, but...	
				The two of you should keep	
				your eyes open.	
0x2270	0x98	Gio		Speaking of which, you seem	
				to be searching for something.	
0x22cc	0x98	Gio		If you are going to the Sacred 	
				Mountain Continent, be careful.	
0x2333	0x98	Gio		Much like Oltapia and Rieseweld, I	
				sense the climate has been very	
				chaotic. You should be fully prepared.	
0x23dc	0x98	Gio		If you are going to the sacred mountain	mp_1099 0x22cc
				continent, take care on your way.	
0x2443	0x98	Gio		The same as Oltapia and Rieseweld,	mp_1099 0x2333
				I sense the climate is very disturbed.	
				Make careful preparations.	
0x2500	0x98	Gio		You have given me a fascinating	
				insight into human life..	
				I must thank you.	
0x2586	0x98	Gio		And you two have done much for	
				the sake of this world as well.	
0x25d6	0x98	Gio		Nayuta, I look forward to	
				working with you in the future.	
0x2650	0x98	Gio		I do not know if our Zext is really	
				the same man as the leader of the Mitos	
				and the creator of Terra, but...	
0x26ec	0x98	Gio		There's no mistaking the great	
				skill needed to capture me or	
				control of the Master Gears.	
0x276b	0x98	Gio		As the Warden of the continent,	
				I cannot allow this existential	
				threat to Terra to continue.	
0x27d9	0x98	Gio		I am sure we will work together soon.	
				Thank you in advance for your help.	
0x2859	0x98	ALTO		Yes, same here.	
0x2888	0x98	ALTO		...By the way, I've been wondering	
				for a while now, but what are those
				things flying around?	
0x2903	0x98	NOI		Those are Geo's spirits.	
0x293c	0x98	Gio		They are spiritual life forms 	
				brought forth by the great Power	
				of Stars from within the continent.	
0x29c0	0x98	Gio		They cannot speak, but they are	
				very hard workers. They've always	
				helped me with various things.	
0x2a3e	0x98	ALTO		I-I see...	
				(This truly is a	
				 strange world...)	
0x2ad2	0x98	Gio		Maybe it's because it was stopped,	
				but the Temple is not in good shape.	
0x2b32	0x98	Gio		It is because you retrieved the	
				Master Gear that we were able	
				to avoid the worst of it, but...	
0x2bb1	0x98	Gio		It is going to take some time for	
				the continent to return to normal.

quest_Gio
0x30c9	0x98	Gio		Oh, it looks like you found	
				Nemeas' spirit without incident.	
0x311a	0x98	Gio		Hmm, so it was caught in the swamp...	
				That's quite unusual for a spirit,	
				who should be in tune with nature.	
0x31b3	0x98	Gio		I do not know why, but maybe	
				it was in a terrible hurry.	
0x3216	0x98	Gio		I feel the presence of Nemeas'	
				spirit in midwestern Oltapia, in	
				the forest known as "Hermit's Path".	
0x32af	0x98	Gio		You might want to set the season	
				to summer and look for it there.	
0x3307	0x98	Gio		I imagine it would be pretty confused.	
				It would be nice of you to save them.	
0x33d9	0x98	Gio		Oh, it seems you successfully	
				found the sandalwood tree.	
				Well done, Nayuta.	
0x344b	0x98	Gio		I trust there's someone waiting for it, no?	
				You should go to them as soon as possible.	
0x34c7	0x98	Gio		The sandalwood tree grows	
				in the summer of Heimmel.	
0x3513	0x98	Gio		If you search Wind Cutting Valley,	
				you should find a pretty big one.	
0x357a	0x98	Gio		If you use it as incense, the two	
				humans will feel more relaxed and	
				able to speak at ease.	
0x36ba	0x98	Gio		A local disk, a special fruit, or	
				anything else, really, will do.	
				I'll let you decide, Nayuta.	
0x3758	0x98	Gio		Gather three things and	
				bring them here to me.	
0x379e	0x98	Gio		Good luck to you.	
QS_24_quest_start
0x39c7	0x98	Gio		So, I'd like to speak

0x3a12	0x98	Gio		Do you not have anything else	
				going on? I don't want to take	
				you from other commitments.	
0x3a7e	0x98	Gio		Oh, I was waiting for you,	
				Nayuta and Noi.	
0x3ac6	0x98	Gio		From the looks of it,

0x3b1e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3b48	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Well, um, yes, in a manner of speaking, but...	
				I'm kind of surprised by how it happened.	
0x3ba4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Finding a letter from YOU

0x3bfb	0x06	NOI		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x3c24	0x98	NOI	#6A	Huh? When did you put a letter
				in Nayuta's mailbox!?	
0x3c88	0x98	Gio		Hehe, I merely searched for a place	
				tightly linked with Nayuta's destiny.	
0x3ce9	0x98	Gio		Aiming at it, I sent the letter	
				with a teleportation technique.	
0x3d63	0x98	Gio		I apologize if it frightened you.

0x43aa	0x98	Gio		The truth is, ever since I

0x4a71	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2

0x4ea0	0x06	Gio		ANI_NOD	
0x4ec4	0x98	Gio		That's exactly right.	
				Hehe, you're a clever boy.	
0x4f11	0x98	Gio		A local disk, a special fruit, or	mp_1099 0x36ba

				I'll let you decide, Nayuta.
0x4faf	0x06	Gio		ANI_GESTURE1

0x1a4d8	0x40	Signa	#0W	One day...

0x1a590	0x40	Signa	#0W	...My existence was

0x1a64c	0x40	Signa	#0W	Yeah, I know it's hard to believe.	
				But Mitos are closer to being

0x1a828	0x40	Signa	#0W	In a manner of speaking, it must	
				have been fate for that me to	
				cross over to Terra once again...		
0x1a88d	0x40	Signa	#0W	After leaving Nayuta, he	
				proceeded toward Oltapia	
				Temple, as if drawn to it.	
0x1a8fe	0x40	Signa	#0W	He had to confront the	
				masked man "Selam" again.	
0x1aac6	0x40	Signa	#0W	The battle was fierce.	
				A true battle to the death.	
0x1ac32	0x40	Signa	#0W	"Cygna" and "Selam" both	
				took a fatal wound, and used	
				up all their strength...

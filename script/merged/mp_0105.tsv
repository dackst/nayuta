0x50f	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Creha... Hope she's all right.	
0x55f	0x98	NOI	#6A	...All we can do is believe in her for now.	
0x5ad	0x98	NOI	#6A	Zext is supposed to be	
				Master Creha's father...	
				I don't think he'd hurt her.

0x66f	0x98	ALTO	#1W	...............	mp_0001 0xc917
0x6a9	0x6B	NOI		Surprise	
0x70a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Nayuta...?	
0x753	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x77d	0x98	ALTO		No... Now that I think about it,	
				this whole thing with Zext is	
				pretty suspicious.	
0x7d2	0x98	ALTO		First of all, how is Zext	
				here on Terra again?	
0x894	0x40	ALTO		Creha showed us the Ancient Memories...	
0x8de	0x40	ALTO		In that image, he should have	
				already taken his last breath.	
0x941	0x40	NOI		T-True...	
0x96e	0x40	NOI		And...I feel that Zext's current	
				personality is too cruel.	
0x9cf	0x40	NOI		I heard from Master Creha that	
				he was a very kind person...	
0xaa9	0x98	NOI	#6A	But Master Creha has been	
				following Zext for the	
				mission of the Mitos...	
0xb17	0x98	NOI	#6A	He's definitely Zext,	
				I'm sure of it.	
0xb73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xb9d	0x98	ALTO		...Anyway, it seems all we can do	
				is confront him directly about it.	
0xbfc	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0xc20	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0xc85	0x98	NOI	#6A	Deep inside here, there's the	
				Planetarium, a crystallization	
				of Power of Stars.	
0xcf4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Zext plans to use it to	
				perform the Remaking...	
0xd4e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0xd73	0x98	ALTO		Let's do whatever we can	
				to get to him before that.	
0xdc5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0xdef	0x98	ALTO		This is probably the final battle...	
				Let's brace ourselves!	
0xe58	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0xe81	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah... Let's do this!	
0x1257	0xCE	Objective		Creha and Cygna are in the lower stratum. Let's hurry!

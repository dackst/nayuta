0x231d	0x98	Reticul		Well, it's nice to meet you.	
0x237b	0x98	ALTO		Umm, I'm Nayuta...

0x23bd	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x23fe	0x98	NOI		N-Nayuta, what is

0x245b	0x98	ALTO		Someone who travels to all

0x24ab	0x98	ALTO		I've never met one in

0x2521	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT0	
0x2549	0x98	Cetus		I'm on a quest to solve

0x25bf	0x98	Cetus		So, I decided to come to Remnant Island,

0x2624	0x06	Cetus		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x264f	0x98	Cetus		We happened to witness you	
				going in and out of that

0x26c8	0x98	Reticul		When we went inside, we	
				ended up discovering it was	
				connected to another world.
0x273d	0x06	Reticul		ANI_THINK	
0x2767	0x98	Reticul		I mean, there seems to be an endless

0x281d	0x98	Reticul		Surely this world has some

0x28bf	0x98	Reticul		Cetus, it's our lucky day!	
0x292e	0x98	Cetus		Oh, you betcha!	
0x295b	0x98	Cetus		...Although, we're not	
				here for treasure...	
0x29ab	0x06	Cetus		ANI_JOY	
0x29d1	0x98	Cetus		At any rate, it is certainly a great discovery.

0x2dab	0x98	Cetus		...Oh, right. There was this one	
				thing I wanted to ask you...	
0x2e09	0x6B	Cetus		Question	
0x2e53	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2e7b	0x98	Cetus		Hm? What are you guys doing here?	
0x2ed0	0x98	Cetus		Are you adventuring alone at your age	
				with that fairy-looking companion?	
0x2f3c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2f64	0x98	ALTO		Well, umm...	
				(Should I ask them,	
				 just in case?)	
0x2fbb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2fe5	0x98	ALTO		Actually, I'm looking for my	
				friend who's gone missing.	
0x3034	0x98	ALTO		He's three years older than me, and he's	
				a tan-skinned young man named Cygna...	
				Have you seen anyone like that?	
0x30c1	0x06	Reticul		ANI_WAIT3	
0x30eb	0x98	Reticul		Hmm, sorry, but	
				I have no idea.	
0x312c	0x98	Reticul		I mean, you're the first people	
				we've run into in this world.	
0x3196	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT3	
0x31be	0x98	Cetus		Hmm, it seems like you've got	
				your work cut out for you...	
0x320d	0x06	Cetus		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3238	0x98	Cetus		We're going to be out exploring	
				more places from now on. 
0x328a	0x98	Cetus		If we see someone matching that description,	
				we'll tell him that you've been looking for him.	
0x3304	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x332c	0x98	ALTO		O-Okay.	
				Thanks...	
0x3369	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT0	
0x3391	0x98	Cetus		Nah, we gotta look out for each	
				other when we're in trouble.	
				So long, Nayuta and Noi.	
0x33f6	0x06	Reticul		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x3423	0x98	Reticul		Let's hope our paths cross again.	
0x3471	0x06	Reticul		ANI_ANGRYTALK	
0x349f	0x98	Reticul		Ah, but as for the treasure, we'll	
				be keeping that all for ourselves.	
				Don't forget!

0x3705	0x98	ALTO		W-Well... I didn't get

				pushy pair of people.	
0x37a2	0x06	NOI		ANI_WORRIED

				have snuck in here again...	
0x3829	0x06	NOI		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x3852	0x98	NOI		I hope they don't end up laying waste to	
				Terra or telling other humans about it...	
				Ooh, this is so unsettling...	
0x3944	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x396e	0x98	ALTO		They don't seem like bad people. I don't think	
				they're going to lay waste to anything.	
0x39e4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x3a0c	0x98	ALTO		We should be on the lookout for next

0x3a7b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x3aa5	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, let's keep going.

				If people like this are here,

0x2183	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT3	
0x21ab	0x98	Cetus		My name is Cetus.	
				I'm an "adventurer" from

0x222f	0x98	Cetus		And this is...

0x22a5	0x98	Reticul		I am Reticul.	
				My older brother Cetus let

0x231d	0x98	Reticul		Well, it's nice to meet you.	
0x237b	0x98	ALTO		Umm, I'm Nayuta...	
				She is called Noi.	
0x23bd	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x23fe	0x98	NOI		N-Nayuta, what is an	
				"adventurer?"	
0x245b	0x98	ALTO		One who travels	
				to various places,	
				chasing dreams.	
0x24ab	0x98	ALTO		This is practically my first time	
				meeting one, though...	
0x2521	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT0	
0x2549	0x98	Cetus		I continue to journey in order	
				to solve the riddles and mysteries	
				throughout the world.	
0x25bf	0x98	Cetus		So, I decided to come to "Remnant Island,"	
				known for its mysteries...	
0x2624	0x06	Cetus		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x264f	0x98	Cetus		By chance, I happened to witness	
				you coming and going from the	
				gate beneath the tree, see.	
0x26c8	0x98	Reticul		When I tried entering it, I could not	
				believe that it connected to this	
				other world.	
0x273d	0x06	Reticul		ANI_THINK	
0x2767	0x98	Reticul		I do not know how far this world

				likes of which I've never seen before.	
0x27f3	0x06	Reticul		ANI_LAUGH	
0x281d	0x98	Reticul		I'm sure of it. There's no mistake that	
				this world has amazing treasures	
				just waiting to be discovered!	
0x28bf	0x98	Reticul		Brother Cetus, we're getting	
				a little carried away!	
0x292e	0x98	Cetus		Oh, our bad!	
0x295b	0x98	Cetus		...And so, our objective isn't	
				more treasures...	
0x29ab	0x06	Cetus		ANI_JOY	
0x29d1	0x98	Cetus		Anyway, there's no mistake that this	
				is a great discovery. The mysteries of this world...	
				By our hands, they will be revealed!

0x2cf3	0x98	ALTO		(R-Right.	
				 If all I can do is talk, then I'll try talking...)	
0x2dab	0x98	Cetus		...Oh, that's right.	
				There's something I want	
				to ask you two...	
0x2e09	0x6B	Cetus		Question	
0x2e53	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2e7b	0x98	Cetus		Hm? That reminds me,	
				what did you two come	
				here to do?	
0x2ed0	0x98	Cetus		Are you adventuring, young as you are,	
				alone with that fairy-like companion?	
0x2f3c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2f64	0x98	ALTO		Well, you see...	
				(I wonder if it's okay to ask him now?)	
0x2fbb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2fe5	0x98	ALTO		The truth is, I am searching for	
				my lost friend.	
0x3034	0x98	ALTO		He is three years older than I,	
				is called Cygna and is a tan-skinned youth...	
				Do you remember anyone like that?	
0x30c1	0x06	Reticul		ANI_WAIT3	
0x30eb	0x98	Reticul		Hmm, sorry but,	
				I have no idea.	
0x312c	0x98	Reticul		Or rather I should say, you are the	
				first human we've met in this world.	
0x3196	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT3	
0x31be	0x98	Cetus		Hmmhmm, it seems there are various problems...	
0x320d	0x06	Cetus		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3238	0x98	Cetus		From here on, we intend to	
				explore various places.	
0x328a	0x98	Cetus		If we see a person matching that	
				description, we'll tell them that you're	
				looking for them.	
0x3304	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x332c	0x98	ALTO		O-Okay.	
				Thank you very much...	
0x3369	0x06	Cetus		ANI_WAIT0	
0x3391	0x98	Cetus		Well, when in trouble, everyone is the same.	
				See you, Nayuta and Noi.	
0x33f6	0x06	Reticul		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x3423	0x98	Reticul		If we have a connection,	
				we will meet again.	
0x3471	0x06	Reticul		ANI_ANGRYTALK	
0x349f	0x98	Reticul		Ah, but as for treasure, we're	
				keeping it all for ourselves.	
				Remember that!	
0x36d7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x3705	0x98	ALTO		O-Okay.	
				I missed my chance to speak...	
0x374a	0x98	NOI		Somehow, they seemed like	
				an overbearing two-person group.	
0x37a2	0x06	NOI		ANI_WORRIED	
0x37ca	0x98	NOI		...Jeez, for something like	
				humans coming here to happen again...	
0x3829	0x06	NOI		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x3852	0x98	NOI		I wonder whether they will lay waste to	
				Terra or tell other humans about it...	
				Ooh, I'm worried about these things...	
0x3944	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x396e	0x98	ALTO		Because they don't seem like bad people,	
				I don't think they will lay waste to anything.	
0x39e4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x3a0c	0x98	ALTO		Because we don't know where we will	
				run into them again, we should be careful...	
0x3a7b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x3aa5	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, let's continue.	
				We've got to search for Cygna and Zext.	
0x3b03	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD

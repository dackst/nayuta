0x113c	0x98	ALTO	#0W	It sure got windy...	
0x131e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_USE_SEXTANT	
0x13cd	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Is it 87.61 degrees?	
				Then the average angle

0x152c	0x98	Signa	#0W#12S	Hey Nayuta,

0x1b62	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x1be7	0x98	Signa	#1W	Don't "Ah, Cygna" me.	
0x1c9b	0x98	Signa	#0W	You weren't in your room,	
				so if you're even thinking of...	
0x1d24	0x98	Signa	#0W	I thought I told you	
				to get some rest tonight.	
0x1d7d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1db5	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	No way, the skies are clear tonight, so I	
				thought it'd be perfect for some stargazing.	
0x1e40	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Now is the time of year the when you can	
				see the Summer Triangle more clearly.

0x2303	0x98	Signa	#0W	The captain said that we should arrive

0x255e	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Hmm... If this were the Academy's observatory,

0x269f	0x98	Signa	#1W	Aw man, you idiot...	
				Listen to your bro, okay?	
0x26f0	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x276c	0x98	Signa	#0W	Your ability to concentrate so hard on	
				something that you can't see anything else	
				around you is USUALLY one of your good traits.	
0x28d0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x292a	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Ahaha, sorry, my bad.	
0x298b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x29df	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Still, it's been about four months since we	
				last came home to Remnant Island, huh?	
0x2a5f	0x98	ALTO	#0W	I hope Lyra, Master and	my sister	
				are all doing well.	
0x2acb	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2b04	0x98	Signa	#0W#6A	It's only been four months.	
				Nothing will have changed.	
0x2b65	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x2b9b	0x98	Signa	#1W#6A	We're finally coming home.	
				I'm planning to take it easy myself.	
0x2c0c	0x98	Signa		And I caught a lucky break. With you at my side, I'll	
				be able to take time off from the town guard.	
0x2cf2	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Yep, whatever you say.	
0x2f74	0x40	ALTO		(Mom and Dad in heaven...	
				 Soon I'll return to the island.)	
0x2fe0	0x40	ALTO		(My sister let me go to Saint Cerise Academy.
				 Everyday, I learned a lot about so many 
				 different subjects.)	
0x305d	0x40	ALTO		(It was tough, hardly ever being able	
				 to contact her... I've got to put a					
				 smile on my face for her tomorrow.)

0x32cb	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	...Look, Cygna!	
0x3370	0x98	Signa	#1W#6A	Oh...	
0x3693	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x378b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x37c3	0x98	ALTO	#0W#16S	...A meteor shower!	
0x380e	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Wow, how beautiful...	
				Hey, look! They're shooting	
				towards Remnant Island!	
0x3892	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Maybe there are star shards inside!	
0x38f5	0x98	Signa	#1W	I'm sure there are.	
				...Even so, it is a nice view.	
0x395f	0x98	Signa	#2W	Haha, perhaps the stars are greeting us.	
0x3add	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x3b2e	0x98	ALTO	#0W	All right! I've got to record	
				these observations right away!	
0x3bd6	0x98	Signa	#0W	...No, Nayuta. I just told	
				you, if you don't sleep,	
				you'll be tired tomorrow.	
0x3c5b	0x98	Signa	#0W	Come on! Get back in the cabin!	
0x3cbc	0xBC	ALTO		Coldsweat	
0x3d3d	0x98	ALTO	#0W#16S	Aww man, seriously...?	
0x3ef8	0x41	None	#1W#2E	This world has an "End"...	
				We have been taught this for as	
				long as anyone can remember.#0E	
0x3fbe	0x41	None	#1W#2E	mp_0101 0xd768
0x4087	0x41	None	#1W#2E	Because of this, many scholars will tell	
				you, "This world is flat." It is a pretty	
				widely-held view about the world. #0E	
0x415e	0x41	None	#1W#2E	...Is that really true?	
				No, I'm sure it's wrong.#0E	
0x420a	0x41	None	#1W#2E	I strongly believe...	
				the world is much, much	
				bigger than that.#0E

0x1b62	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x1be7	0x98	Signa	#1W	Don't "Ah, Cygna" me.	
0x1c9b	0x98	Signa	#0W	You're not in your room,	
				so if you're even thinking of...	
0x1d24	0x98	Signa	#0W	I thought I told you to get	
				some rest tonight.	
0x1d7d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1db5	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	No way, the skies are clear tonight,	
				so I was thinking that it's perfect for stargazing.	
0x1e40	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Since now's about the time when	
				you can see the Summer Triangle more clearly.

0x2303	0x98	Signa	#0W	The captain said that we should be at	
				<Remnant Island> by morning.	
0x2376	0x98	Signa	#0W	You better head to bed now,

0x255e	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Hmm,

				Listen to your bro, yeah?	
0x26f0	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x276c	0x98	Signa	#0W	When you're concentrating so hard that

0x292a	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Ahaha, sorry, my bad.	
0x298b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x29df	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Still, it's been about 4 months since we	
				last came home to <Remnant Island>, eh?	
0x2a5f	0x98	ALTO	#0W	It would be good if my sister, Lyra and	
				Master are all doing fine.	
0x2acb	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2b04	0x98	Signa	#0W#6A	It's only been four months.	
				Nothing much will have changed.	
0x2b65	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x2b9b	0x98	Signa	#1W#6A	It's our long-awaited return home.	
				I'm going to take it easy.	
0x2c0c	0x98	Signa		And I caught a lucky break. With you at my side, I'll be able	
				to take days off from the vigilance committee.	
0x2cf2	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Yep, that's right.	
0x2f74	0x40	ALTO		(Mother and father in heaven...

0x2fe0	0x40	ALTO		(I learned about various things every day at	
				 San Cerize Academy that my sister let me go to.)	
0x305d	0x40	ALTO		(It was tough, barely being able to

0x37c3	0x98	ALTO	#0W#16S	......A meteor shower!	
0x380e	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Wow, how beautiful...	
				Hey, look! They're shooting in the	
				direction of Remnant Island!	
0x3892	0x98	ALTO	#1W	I wonder if there are <Star Shards>	
				inside!	
0x38f5	0x98	Signa	#1W	I'm sure there are.	
				......Even so, it's a beautiful view.	
0x395f	0x98	Signa	#2W	Haha, I wonder if the stars are	
				greeting us perhaps.	
0x3add	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x3b2e	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Alright! I've got to record these	
				observations right away!	
0x3bd6	0x98	Signa	#0W	...No, Nayuta.	
				I just told you. If you don't	
				sleep, it will affect your day tomorrow.	
0x3c5b	0x98	Signa	#0W	Come on! Get back in the cabin!	
0x3cbc	0xBC	ALTO		Coldsweat

0x3ef8	0x41	None	#1W#2E	This world has an "End"...	
				We have been taught this for as long

0x3fbe	0x41	None	#1W#2E	Even the sea which stretches to	mp_0101 0xd768
				infinity has a distinct end...	
				beyond which one cannot go.#0E	
0x4087	0x41	None	#1W#2E	Which is why many scholars say:	
				"This world is flat." This is a pretty common 	
				perception of the world. #0E	
0x415e	0x41	None	#1W#2E	......I wonder if it's really true.	
				No, I'm sure it's wrong.#0E	
0x420a	0x41	None	#1W#2E	I strongly believe......	
				that the world is much, much	
				bigger than that.#0E

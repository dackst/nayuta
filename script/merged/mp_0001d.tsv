0x484	0x98	ALTO		I don't have time for any detours...	
				I've got to look for Kureha!	
quest_Pyxia
0x548	0x98	Pyxia		...Mishy? What's that?	
				I haven't seen him.	
0x594	0x98	Pyxia		At least, I don't think he's	
				gone to the Tower Ruins.	
talk_Pyxia
0x616	0x98	Pyxia		Though I asked that pretty girl	
				to model for my picture...	
0x670	0x98	Pyxia		...She said she doesn't have	
				time for that sort of thing.	
0x6c9	0x98	Pyxia		I'm going to sock that man in	
				black with a spatula the	
				next time I see him!	
0x75b	0x98	Pyxia		That man in black...	
				I won't forgive him!	
0x7a4	0x98	Pyxia		If I find him, I'll	
				sock him with a spatula!	
talk_Horolo
0x81e	0x98	Horolo		It looks like there are most	
				of the buildings on the island	
				that are unharmed.	
0x88c	0x98	Horolo		It also looks like only the people	
				that resisted were injured...	
0x8ef	0x98	Horolo		I really get the feeling that	
				he came to the island just	
				to steal away that girl...	
0x98a	0x98	Horolo		Why did that man in black	
				come to the island to just	
				steal a single girl?	
0x9ef	0x98	Horolo		Was there some special	
				reason or something...?	
talk_Lyra
0xa74	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xa9d	0x98	ALTO		Lyra...if you hang around a place	
				like this, you'll catch a cold.	
0xae8	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, I know that, but...	
0xb21	0x98	Lyra		...Kureha... Why did she follow him...?	
0xb70	0x98	Lyra		If she hated us that	
				much, then why...?	
0xbb5	0x98	ALTO		I don't know, but...	
0xbe9	0x98	ALTO		Kureha was grateful to	
				everyone on the island...	
				She said she had fun here.	
0xc4a	0x98	ALTO		That's why I'm sure,	
				Kureha wouldn't want
				anything like this.	
0xcb3	0x98	ALTO		...That's reason enough for me.	
0xcf2	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xd1b	0x98	Lyra		...Yeah, got it.	
				I believe in you, Nayuta.	
0xd64	0x98	Lyra		If you say it like that, you leave	
				me wondering what kind of unreasonable	
				thing you're trying to do.	
0xddf	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...that might be true.	
0xe1a	0x98	Lyra		Unfortunately, I was right, *sigh*...	
0xe62	0x98	Lyra		Well, fine. It seems like Cygna	
				is missing in that world, too.	
0xeb3	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, please look after	
				those two. I'm sure you	
				can bring them back to us!	
0xf46	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta... I'm sure you'll bring	
				back Cygna and Kureha to us!	
0xfa1	0x98	Lyra		I'll be waiting on this island.	
				For all of you to return.

0x1092	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x10bc	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x10ee	0x98	ALTO		Come to think of it...	mp_0001 0x391b
				I bought a doghouse	
				at the general store, didn't I?	
0x115c	0x98	ALTO		I should be able to use it to	mp_0001 0x3989
				give this little guy a place	
				shielded from wind and rain...	
0x11ca	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x11fc	0x98	ALTO		Hey, you, want to come to my place?	mp_0001 0x3a29

0x126f	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff! â™ª	mp_0001 0x3a9c
0x129a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, is that so?	mp_0001 0x3ac7
0x12cc	0x98	ALTO		All right...I'll discuss it	mp_0001 0x3af9
				it with Eartha immediately.
0x1349	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta returned home, and discussed	mp_0001 0x3b76
				the stray dog with Eartha.	
0x13ad	0x40	UNDEF		Though Eartha was surprised at first, she gladly	mp_0001 0x3bda
				approved of the idea once informed of the situation.	
0x1540	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x156a	0x98	ALTO		Huh, I haven't seen you before.	mp_0001 0x3d94
0x15a9	0x98	ALTO		I wonder if you wandered onto	mp_0001 0x3dd3
				the ferry and came ashore	
				onto this island.	
0x1610	0x6B	Dog		Unknown	
0x1641	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff...	mp_0001 0x3e6b
0x166d	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, how cute.	mp_0001 0x3e97
0x16a0	0x98	ALTO		(...That's right, maybe	mp_0001 0x3f89
				 I can keep it at home?)	
0x16f6	0x98	ALTO		(But I'd like to have a	decent	mp_0001 0x3fdf	
				 doghouse... Maybe I should look	
				 for one at the general store?)	
0x17f7	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x1821	0x98	ALTO		(If I had a doghouse, I could	mp_0001c 0x3ddd
				 keep him at home, but...)

0x484	0x98	ALTO		This is no time to get sidetracked...	
				I've got to look for Kureha!	
quest_Pyxia
0x548	0x98	Pyxia		...Mishy? What's that?	
				I haven't seen him.	
0x594	0x98	Pyxia		At least, I don't think he's	
				gone to the Tower Ruins.	
talk_Pyxia
0x616	0x98	Pyxia		I wanted to ask that beautiful girl	
				to model for my painting...	
0x670	0x98	Pyxia		...Now's not that time for mentioning	
				about that sort of thing.	
0x6c9	0x98	Pyxia		If I ever find that man in	
				black again, I'm gonna whack	
				him with a spatula!	
0x75b	0x98	Pyxia		That man in black...	
				It's unforgivable!	
0x7a4	0x98	Pyxia		If I ever find him again, I'll	
				whack him with a spatula!	
talk_Horolo
0x81e	0x98	Horolo		Looks like most of the buildings	
				on the island came out unscathed.	
0x88c	0x98	Horolo		And only the people who	
				resisted were injured...	
0x8ef	0x98	Horolo		I'm really starting to get the	
				feeling that they came here	
				just to take away that girl...	
0x98a	0x98	Horolo		Why would that man in black	
				come all they way here to	
				just steal a single girl?	
0x9ef	0x98	Horolo		Was there some special	
				reason or something...?	
talk_Lyra
0xa74	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xa9d	0x98	ALTO		Lyra... If you hang around here	
				like this, you'll catch a cold.	
0xae8	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, I know, but...	
0xb21	0x98	Lyra		...Kureha... Why did	
				she go with him...?	
0xb70	0x98	Lyra		Did she hate us	
				that much...?	
0xbb5	0x98	ALTO		I don't know, but...	
0xbe9	0x98	ALTO		Kureha was grateful to	
				everyone on the island...	
				She said she had fun here.	
0xc4a	0x98	ALTO		That's why I'm sure, this isn't	
				what Kureha really wants.	
0xcb3	0x98	ALTO		...That's good enough for me.	
0xcf2	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xd1b	0x98	Lyra		...Yeah, I understand.	
				I believe you, Nayuta.	
0xd64	0x98	Lyra		But if you start talking like that, it	
				feels like you have something reckless	
				on your mind you're about to do.
0xddf	0x98	ALTO		Haha... You might be right.	
0xe1a	0x98	Lyra		So I WAS right, *sigh*...	
0xe62	0x98	Lyra		Well, whatever. From what you	
				said, Cygna has gone missing	
				in that world, too.	
0xeb3	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, please look after	
				them both. You can bring	
				them back to us, right?	
0xf46	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta... You have to bring
				Cygna and Kureha back to us!	
0xfa1	0x98	Lyra		I'll be waiting on this island.	
				For all of you to return.

0x10bc	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x10ee	0x98	ALTO		Come to think of it...	mp_0001 0x391b
				I bought a doghouse	
				at the general store, didn't I?	
0x115c	0x98	ALTO		I should be able to use it to	mp_0001 0x3989
				give this little guy a place	
				shielded from wind and rain...	
0x11ca	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x11fc	0x98	ALTO		Hey, you, want to come to my place?	mp_0001 0x3a29

0x129a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, is that so?	mp_0001 0x3ac7
0x12cc	0x98	ALTO		All right...I'll discuss it	mp_0001 0x3af9
				it with Eartha immediately.
0x1349	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta returned home, and discussed	mp_0001 0x3b76
				the stray dog with Eartha.	
0x13ad	0x40	UNDEF		Though Eartha was surprised at first, she gladly	mp_0001 0x3bda
				approved of the idea once informed of the situation.	
0x1540	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x156a	0x98	ALTO		Huh, I haven't seen you before.	mp_0001 0x3d94
0x15a9	0x98	ALTO		I wonder if you wandered onto	mp_0001 0x3dd3
				the ferry and came ashore	
				onto this island.	
0x1610	0x6B	Dog		Unknown	
0x1641	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff...	mp_0001 0x3e6b
0x166d	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, how cute.	mp_0001 0x3e97
0x16a0	0x98	ALTO		(...That's right, maybe	mp_0001 0x3f89
				 I can keep it at home?)	
0x16f6	0x98	ALTO		(But I'd like to have a decent	mp_0001 0x3fdf	
				 doghouse... Maybe I should look	
				 for one at the general store?)	
0x17f7	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x1821	0x98	ALTO		(If I had a doghouse, I could	mp_0001c 0x3ddd
				 keep him at home, but...)

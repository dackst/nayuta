0x38c6	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x38ee	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The request from Nemeas...

0x3aa4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Well, there were never

0x3b14	0x98	Nemeas		Indeed, it is very troubling...	
0x3b58	0x06	Nemeas		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3b84	0x98	Nemeas		I am sorry to do this, given the

0x3c28	0x06	Nemeas		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3c54	0x98	Nemeas		I have a request to make

0x3cae	0x98	Nemeas		Though I am sorry to oblige you	mp_4099 0x3b84

0x3f08	0x06	Nemeas		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x3f34	0x98	Nemeas		If a more opportune time arises,

0x4139	0x98	Nemeas		The truth is...the spirits in charge

0x440e	0x06	Nemeas		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x443a	0x98	Nemeas		Of all my spirits, these little

0x4493	0x98	Nemeas		Therefore, I've always told them,

0x47eb	0x98	NOI	#6A	But Nemeas, if not even you can sense them...

0x4864	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0x4889	0x98	Nemeas		I am sorry to say...

0x4950	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x4978	0x98	ALTO	#6A	So if not even the Warden

0x49e3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2

0x4b6f	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x4b95	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hmm, since spirits are part of

0x4c13	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD

0x4cd8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yeah, let's try visiting

0x4d5d	0x06	Nemeas		GESTURE1	
0x4d85	0x98	Nemeas		Then, it might be appropriate to check

0x4de9	0x98	Nemeas		They should be able to detect any

0x4e62	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD

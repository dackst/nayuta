0x2917	0x98	Lyra		(With this situation,	
				 I should wait awhile	
				 before confessing...)	
0x2977	0x98	Lyra		(Even though I was	
				 so determined...)	
0x29bb	0x98	Lyra		......Ahhh......	
0x29eb	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, what could be the matter	
				if you let out such a big sigh.	
0x2a48	0x98	NOI		Is your health OK?	
0x2a8e	0x98	Lyra		...Geez, even if you lost your memory,	
				it's the same as before.	
0x2aec	0x98	Lyra		You appear with that kind of timing,	
				and I can't be sensible!	
0x2b48	0x6B	NOI		Unknown	
0x2b79	0x98	NOI		H-Huh?	
0x2b9e	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, calm down.	
				I don't get your meaning...	
0x2bff	0x98	Lyra		Oh well, it's fine.	
				Just get out of here.	
0x2c47	0x98	Lyra		For you guys now,	
				the most important thing is	
				to save Cygna and Kureha, right?	
0x2cb3	0x98	ALTO		...Understood. Well, we'll	
				leave for the time being.	
0x2d06	0x98	ALTO		When everything is over, let's	
				take our time talking.	
				When that time comes, I'll ask you about today's conversation.	
0x2d98	0x98	Lyra		...O-Okay.	mp_0100 0x12b0b
0x2dfc	0x98	Lyra		As for me, please leave	
				me alone for the time being.	
0x2e4f	0x98	Lyra		For you guys now,	mp_0112 0x2c47
				the most important thing is	
				to save Cygna and Kureha, right?	
0x2ebb	0x98	Lyra		Once you have completed what you	
				must do, return safely, OK!?	
0x2f3f	0x98	Lyra		For you guys now,	mp_0112 0x2c47
				the most important thing is	
				to save Cygna and Kureha, right?	
0x2fab	0x98	Lyra		Once you have completed what you	mp_0112 0x2ebb
				must do, return safely, OK!?	
0x303d	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, thank you for earlier.	
				...I'm happy that you came for me.	
0x309d	0x98	ALTO		No, I have to apologize too...	
				Sorry for always worrying you.	
0x30f9	0x98	ALTO		...From here on, we will be going	
				to where Kureha is.	
0x314d	0x98	ALTO		That might worry you again, but...	
				Somehow, please wait for me.	
0x31ab	0x98	Lyra		...I understand.	
				If you say that,	
				then I can't stop.	
0x31fd	0x98	Lyra		Noi, please take care of Nayuta.	
0x323d	0x98	NOI		Leave everything to me!	
0x329b	0x98	Lyra		Be careful as you go, you two.	
				Even though I'm worried,	
				I'll be waiting here.	
0x3306	0x98	Lyra		About Kureha and Cygna...	
				Somehow, please take care of them.	
0x33ce	0x98	Lyra		Hey, is that called "snow?"	
				When you touch it, it becomes water.	
0x342d	0x98	Lyra		Like very cold rain...	
				I wonder what it's like.	
				Hmm, I don't exactly know...	
0x34cd	0x98	Lyra		Huh, Kureha?	
0x34f9	0x98	Lyra		If it's Kureha you're talking about, I gave her	
				an errand earlier. I heard she said she will	
				help out with anything, no matter what.	
0x359b	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...	
				Do you know where she went?	
0x35e3	0x98	Lyra		Hmm, she went to the elder's place, but...	
				She should have been back by now...	
0x3650	0x98	Lyra		She might have stopped by somewhere	
				along the way.	
				...I'm a little interested in it too...	
0x36c8	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...Then, I'll try looking for her.	
				Don't worry about it Lyra.	
0x372e	0x98	Lyra		Huh!? O-Okay...	
0x3797	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have given	
				her something like an errand, maybe...	
0x37ff	0x98	Lyra		I'm worried about it,	
				and now I can't focus on my work!	
0x3855	0x98	ALTO		Ohhh...	
				(Even though Lyra might say mean things,	
				 her true self is kind.)	
0x38e4	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have given	mp_0112 0x3797
				her something like an errand, maybe...	
0x394c	0x98	Lyra		Just where is that girl	
				wandering about, I wonder...	
0x39d5	0x98	Lyra		Welcome～...	
0x3a01	0x98	Lyra		(...Just now, it seems like that	
				 girl was in front of the shop...	
				 Maybe it was my imagination...)	
0x3a82	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, somehow, you don't seem well.	
				What's wrong?	
0x3ad2	0x98	Lyra		Whose fault do you think that is!?	mp_0110 0x2813e
0x3b14	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x3b46	0x98	ALTO		(Huh...I-It's my fault!?)	
0x3bb9	0x98	Lyra		It's no good, it's no good,	
				something like that girl coming...	
				I'm sure it's a hallucination.	
0x3c34	0x98	Lyra		That's right...If I remember correctly,	
				I was requested to go to Carina's place	
				and look after Collie today.	
0x3cbe	0x98	Lyra		For a change of pace for awhile,	
				I should get going.	
0x3d47	0x98	Lyra		Aaaaaaah...	
0x3d72	0x98	Lyra		It can't be...something like that...	
0x3db6	0x98	Lyra		...No, I still can't	
				undertake something that serious...	
0x3e0d	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x3e3f	0x98	ALTO		(Lyra, what's wrong...?)	
0x3e9f	0x98	Lyra		...Aaaaaah...	
				Her skin is so pretty, and she's so beautiful...	
0x3efc	0x98	Lyra		...No, even I still have some chance...	
0x3f79	0x98	Lyra		Oh, Nayuta.	
				Cygna's not with you?	
0x3fb9	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah.	
				He had a little something else to do.	
0x4005	0x98	ALTO		..................	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0x4037	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	
				Somehow, you don't seem well.	
0x407d	0x98	Lyra		Could it be,	
				you got in a fight with Cygna?	
0x40c7	0x98	ALTO		...I wonder about that.	
				Even I don't understand exactly what happened.	
0x412c	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna...	
				 Why in the world are you doing this...)	
0x417d	0x6B	Lyra		Unknown	
0x41af	0x98	Lyra		I can't do anything between	
				you two anymore.	
0x41fa	0x98	Lyra		You know, even at the best of times,	
				there's still three years' difference between you,	
				so it's natural that there are things you can't understand.	
0x42ab	0x98	Lyra		Anyway, because of that,	
				all you can do is speak frankly about it.	
0x430c	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x433e	0x6B	Lyra		Question	
0x4370	0x98	Lyra		W-What?	
				You got quiet all of a sudden...	
0x43b7	0x98	ALTO		...Ahaha, it's nothing.	
				As expected, you are	
				like you are, I was thinking.	
0x441f	0x98	ALTO		Thank you. Thanks to you,	
				my spirits are lifted a little.	
0x4477	0x98	Lyra		W-What are you saying?	
				You're strange, Nayuta.	
0x44fe	0x98	Lyra		I don't exactly understand but...	
				It's good that you're close	
				with Cygna.	
0x4565	0x98	Lyra		I've got to go to Eartha for	
				a cooking lesson after this.	
0x45bd	0x98	Lyra		I don't have time to be concerned	
				with you guys 24 hours a day.	
0x4643	0x98	Lyra		Anyway, if you're fighting with	
				Cygna, you should reconcile	
				quickly.	
0x46a5	0x98	Lyra		If you guys weren't fighting, you wouldn't	
				be you. Geez...	
0x4734	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, it look like you're both fine.	
				...Thank goodness.	
0x478a	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, you're helping	
				with the shop?	
0x480e	0x98	Lyra		Ah, yeah...	
				Because that big of a ruin has	
				fallen, there's various things to do.	
0x487c	0x98	Lyra		Say, Nayuta...	
				Somehow, you're super	
				excited, right?	
0x48ce	0x98	ALTO		R-R-Really?	
0x48f9	0x98	Lyra		Well, I can see through you that much	
				at least. I've known you since you	
				were a toddler, after all.	
0x497a	0x98	Lyra		Anyhow, I knew you'd go explore	
				the new ruin that's fallen.	
0x49d4	0x98	Lyra		Good grief, you haven't	
				changed at all...	
0x4a1c	0x98	Lyra		...No, that might be wrong.	
				It seems that since Cygna came to the	
				island, he hasn't been with you much...	
0x4aa3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4ad5	0x98	ALTO		Umm, Lyra?	
				You're derailing our conversation...	
0x4b23	0x98	Lyra		...A-Anyway, understand?	
				Don't go anywhere too	
				dangerous, OK?	
0x4b7e	0x98	Lyra		I won't forgive you if	
				you get injured or anything!	
0x4bd0	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...Got it.	
				I'm no match for you, Lyra.	
0x4c66	0x98	Lyra		I get the feeling that you're	
				doing dangerous things again,	
				Nayuta...	
0x4cc9	0x98	Lyra		Understand? Don't go anywhere	
				too dangerous, OK?	
0x4d18	0x98	Lyra		If you get hurt or anything,	
				I'll never forgive you!	
0x4d93	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, whenever you're thinking	
				something I can see right	
				through you.	
0x4df8	0x98	Lyra		If you get hurt or anything,	mp_0112 0x4d18
				I'll never forgive you!	
talk_Lyra_and_Creha
0x4eb7	0x98	Lyra		On the stairs there is a bottle.	
				I'm keeping that one for	
				that customer...	
0x4f1f	0x98	Creha		...This one?	
				There's still plenty inside.	
0x4f68	0x98	Lyra		N-No! That's high-class	
				wine aged 20 years...	
				Just don't drop it!	
talk_Barton
0x5064	0x98	Barton		Hmm, looking at the situation,	
				I missed the timing...	
0x50ba	0x98	Barton		Hehe, though she is my daughter,	
				her bad timing is hardcore.	
0x5155	0x98	Lyra		Oh enough already,	
				Quiet father!	
0x51e0	0x98	Barton		Hehe, though she is my daughter,	mp_0112 0x50ba
				her bad timing is hardcore.	
0x523d	0x98	Barton		Well, please get along with her	
				from now on.	
0x52c0	0x98	Barton		Hey Nayuta.	
				It seems you promised to	
				spend time with Lyra today.	
0x5320	0x98	Barton		I'm sorry, your Handyman Shop	
				work must be busy.	
0x5371	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, it's all right.	
				I'm just having a little	
				chat before work.	
0x53d0	0x98	ALTO		Even though it's a special return,	
				I'm sorry I haven't had idle time	
				until now.	
0x543d	0x98	Barton		Haha, is that right.	
				I'm sure Lyra will be happy about that.	
0x549a	0x98	Barton		Well, if you can, I think she	
				would be delighted if you	
				could answer her feelings...	
0x550e	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x5540	0x98	Barton		Whoops, nevermind.	
				Well, please enjoy spending	
				time together today.	
0x55cb	0x98	Barton		Hehe, that was just my	
				parental love coming out.	
0x561c	0x98	Barton		Well, please don't worry about it.	
				Please take care of Lyra.	
0x56af	0x98	Barton		Including me, people receive	
				many thing from the sea	
				and nature...	
0x5711	0x98	Barton		And until now, never once	
				returned anything.	
0x575e	0x98	Barton		If I think about that, the abnormalities	
				occurring on this ocean are...	
				perhaps our natural reward.	
0x57e1	0x98	Barton		Even so, I want to protect my	
				precious family and friends.	
				...That is what I earnestly think.	
0x5886	0x98	Barton		The abnormalities occurring on this ocean	
				may be humanity's natural reward.	
0x58f2	0x98	Barton		Even so, it want to protect my	
				precious family and friends.	
				...That is what I earnestly think.	
0x59a6	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, Noi...	
				It seems you saved	
				Lyra and the others.	
0x59fc	0x98	Barton		Thank you, truly...	
				We're always being saved by you.	
0x5a51	0x98	ALTO		No, I too am also sorry	
				for always worrying Lyra.	
0x5aa1	0x98	ALTO		Also...	
				Because of what's happening,	
				I've made up my mind.	
0x5af9	0x98	ALTO		I'm truly thankful	
				to Lyra.	
0x5b33	0x98	NOI		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x5b5b	0x98	Barton		Is that so...	
				Thank you for saying that.	
0x5ba4	0x98	Barton		Hehe, please take care of	
				her from now on.	
0x5c29	0x98	Barton		Lyra said she was taking the day off...	
				That girl must be thinking something.	
0x5c97	0x98	Barton		Anyhow, please take care of	
				that from now on.	
0x5ce5	0x98	Barton		And please, come back	
				safely for me.	
0x5d52	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, Noi...	
				Everyone has been supporting you.	
0x5da3	0x98	Barton		Please, come back	
				safely for me.	
0x5e1a	0x98	Barton		Nayuta...	
				You've finally awakened.	
				Truly, thank goodness...	
0x5e75	0x98	Barton		Lyra was worried too.	
				She will be delighted.	
0x5ec2	0x98	ALTO		Thank you very much.	
				...Where is Lyra now?	
0x5f0b	0x98	Barton		She just left.	
				She should be back soon.	
0x5f53	0x98	Barton		...Don't work too hard.	
				You seem tired.	
0x5f9b	0x98	ALTO		Yes...Understood.	
0x6025	0x98	Barton		You are Noi, aren't you.	
0x605f	0x98	Barton		It seems you were wounded too...	
				Please take care of Nayuta.	
0x60bc	0x98	NOI		Y-Yeah, I will.	
0x6112	0x98	Barton		Lyra will be back soon.	
0x614b	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, don't work too hard.	
				You seem tired.	
0x61ce	0x98	Barton		It seems Lyra	
				went to the cape.	
0x620e	0x98	Barton		It seems you are becoming	
				close with Kureha.	
0x625b	0x98	Barton		...Nayuta, if it's all right with you,	
				please take care of her.	
0x62e3	0x98	Barton		Come to think of it, it seems the elder	
				and the others are in the plaza	
				talking.	
0x6353	0x98	Barton		...No, don't say such unrefined things.	
				You must be in shock too.	
0x63d1	0x98	Barton		I thought it was noisy outside,	
				and it seems the thing called	
				"snow" is falling.	
0x6441	0x98	Barton		Sure, when Orvus had just	
				come to the island I asked	
				him about it but...	
0x64a9	0x98	Barton		It seems it's a climate phenomenon	
				seen in the north sea and on the	
				continent...	
0x654d	0x98	Barton		Just now, Kureha came	
				to introduce herself.	
0x6599	0x98	Barton		She was so charming that a	
				remote inn such as this is	
				unbecoming...	
0x65fc	0x98	Barton		Hehe, I finally understand the	
				reason that Lyra is depressed.	
0x6682	0x98	Barton		I should try asking Lyra	
				about Kureha.	
0x66c9	0x98	Barton		To get them to be closer, I'll	
				ask Kureha to help with work.	
0x6742	0x98	Barton		Lyra went out.	
				She was asked to look	
				after Carina's baby.	
0x679b	0x98	Barton		She should be walking around the village...	
				I don't know the exact location.	
0x683c	0x98	Barton		(Hmm, how Lyra is doing...	
				 Somehow, it seems something	
				 happened, Nayuta.)	
0x68a7	0x98	ALTO		(Umm, why are we	
				 whispering like this?)	
0x68ee	0x98	Barton		(Hehe, it's because	
				 I'm her father.)	
0x6934	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6966	0x98	ALTO		(Sometimes I just don't	
				 get old man Barton...)	
0x69dc	0x98	Barton		(Hmm, how Lyra is doing...	mp_0112 0x683c
				 Somehow, it seems something	
				 happened, Nayuta.)	
0x6a47	0x98	Barton		(Hehe, I'll cheer for you secretly.)	
0x6ac3	0x98	Barton		Everyone, like myself, is delighted	
				that Eartha was saved.	
0x6b1e	0x98	Barton		Well, myself even moreso.	
0x6b59	0x98	Barton		I watched over your house	
				this whole time, too.	
				I am full of deep emotion.	
0x6bc3	0x98	Barton		By the way...At a time like this,	
				I wonder what Lyra is doing.	
0x6c22	0x98	Barton		She returned just now in a panic,	
				and she seems strangely	
				depressed...	
0x6cb0	0x98	Barton		The people of this island	
				share each other's	
				pain and delight, it seems.	
0x6d18	0x98	Barton		As one of this island,	
				I'm proud of that.	
0x6d98	0x98	Barton		It seems Eartha collapsed...	
				Hmm, I'm worried about her...	
0x6df3	0x98	Barton		Lyra couldn't sit still anymore and	
				went to help. My feelings are	
				the same.	
0x6e5e	0x98	Barton		I will handle the shop affairs myself somehow.	
				Nayuta, if you need something,	
				please ask Lyra to do it.	
0x6f0d	0x98	Barton		Lyra went over there to	
				help too for awhile.	
0x6f5a	0x98	Barton		I will handle the shop affairs myself somehow.	
				Please use Lyra if you need something.	
0x7006	0x98	Barton		Axe and Sculp often	
				drink at this house.	
0x704f	0x98	Barton		Hehe, they're like old friends.	
				We've accumulated many stories.	
0x70af	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, you might come here	
				to drink with Cygna someday.	
0x7108	0x98	Barton		Whoops, if Lyra asks you,	
				you might stand on this	
				side of the counter...	
0x7170	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x71a2	0x98	ALTO		Umm, what do you mean by that...?	
0x71e3	0x98	Barton		...Hehe, nevermind.	
				Please ignore it.	
0x7263	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, you might come here	mp_0112 0x70af
				to drink with Cygna someday.	
0x72bc	0x98	Barton		If Lyra asks you,	
				you might stand on this	
				side of the counter...	
0x731c	0x98	Barton		Hehe, personally,	
				I'm looking forward to it.	
0x7391	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, you might come here	mp_0112 0x70af
				to drink with Cygna someday.	
0x73ea	0x98	Barton		Please treasure your friends.	
				They are a lifetime's fortune.	
0x747d	0x98	Barton		This "Remnant Island" is almost	
				in middle of the Ciencia Sea and	
				you can't say it's easy to access by any standard.	
0x7510	0x98	Barton		The sole ferry takes more than	
				half a day... 	
				Well, the backcountry is a good place.	
0x7584	0x98	Barton		However, for a long time,	
				the air has been clear, and you can	
				often see shooting stars.	
0x75fb	0x98	Barton		We get visitors for that...	
				And astronomers like your dad, too.	
0x765b	0x98	ALTO		Come to think of it,	
				you drink quite a bit,	
				old man Barton.	
0x76b4	0x98	ALTO		Since I was little,	
				I remember that much, but...	
0x7703	0x98	Barton		Haha, you'd get along with him.	
0x7744	0x98	Barton		He often observed the night sky,	
				and exchanged drinks.	
0x77c3	0x98	Barton		Speaking of Remnant Island,	
				tourists know it as an island	
				where ruins fall from the sky...	
0x783d	0x98	Barton		And it has the virtue of	
				being able to see the	
				stars well.	
0x7897	0x98	Barton		An astronomer like your dad	
				was enchanted by the place.	
0x7925	0x98	Barton		Phew, that was dangerous.	
				I almost broke that bottle.	
0x797b	0x98	ALTO		Old man Barton...	
				Are you all right?	
0x79be	0x98	Barton		Yeah, I was able to catch it	
				before it fell on the floor.	
0x7a18	0x98	Barton		I was surprised at	
				how sudden it was.	
0x7a5e	0x98	ALTO		(Haha...Old man Barton	
				 never gets agitated	
				 no matter the situation.)	
0x7aea	0x98	Barton		But that was an amazing quake...	
				I've got to check the condition	
				of the second floor later.	
0x7b65	0x98	Barton		Anyhow, it was just about	
				to say I'm glad the customers	
				didn't get hurt.	
0x7c03	0x98	Barton		Oh...If it isn't Nayuta.	
				Haha, you've returned, eh?	
0x7c57	0x98	ALTO		Yes, just now.	
				It's been awhile, old man.	
0x7c9f	0x98	ALTO		How is your shop doing?	
0x7cd6	0x98	Barton		Haha, nothing ever goes on	
				in a remote bar like this.	
				Nothing much has changed.	
0x7d45	0x98	Barton		On days when the ferry comes,	
				we get some tourists.	
				That's about it.	
0x7da9	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, it seems nothing has	
				happened.	
0x7ded	0x98	ALTO		Oh, but what about Lyra...?	
				It looks like she's not in the	
				shop today.	
0x7e51	0x98	Barton		The truth is, I just asked her	
				to do something for me.	
0x7ea8	0x98	Barton		I think she's a little late	
				coming back, but...	
0x7ef8	0x98	Barton		Well, sorry to keep you waiting,	
				Nayuta. I'll let you know if	
				she returns.	
0x7f62	0x98	ALTO		Understood. Thanks.	
0x7f95	0x98	ALTO		(Lyra...	
				 I hope she's well.)	
0x800b	0x98	Barton		You guys played with Lyra	
				since you were kids.	
0x805a	0x98	Barton		If you guys have returned,	
				she'll be delighted.	
0x80aa	0x98	Barton		If she returns from her	
				errand, I'll let you know	
				right away.	
0x812f	0x98	Barton		If you guys have returned,	mp_0112 0x805a
				she'll be delighted.	
0x817f	0x98	Barton		If she returns from her	mp_0112 0x80aa
				errand, I'll let you know	
				right away.	
talk_Gruz
0x8224	0x98	Gruz		Gahaha, I'm happy that	
				you've returned, little Noi.	
0x8276	0x98	Gruz		The Star Festival this time	
				and your welcome party	
				will be grand.	
0x82d5	0x98	Gruz		I'll make the food with all	
				I've got, so please look	
				forward to it!	
0x835e	0x98	Gruz		I'm happy that	
				you've returned, little Noi.	
0x83a8	0x98	Gruz		I've got to do the Star Festival	
				and welcome party this time.	
				Look forward to them!	
0x844f	0x98	Gruz		Around yesterday, Lyra's	
				condition was strange.	
0x849d	0x98	Gruz		She was thoughtlessly hitting her head	
				while mumbling in a monologue, and	
				her face turned red while in deep thought...	
0x8531	0x98	Gruz		...Well, it's because she's a girl	
				of that age. Something might	
				be troubling her.	
0x85a0	0x98	Gruz		Because I'm a guy, I can't	
				exactly ask her about it,	
				little Nayuta.	
0x8629	0x98	Gruz		...Well, it's because she's a girl	mp_0112 0x8531
				of that age. Something might	
				be troubling her.	
0x8698	0x98	Gruz		Because I'm a guy, I can't	mp_0112 0x85a0
				exactly ask her about it,	
				little Nayuta.	
0x872f	0x98	Gruz		If you're hungry or something...	
				You've been asking me things	
				like that for a long time.	
0x87a5	0x98	Gruz		For getting over a great wall,	
				the most important thing is	
				stamina.	
0x8806	0x98	Gruz		Anyway, eat plenty of food,	
				gain plenty of strength, and handle it	
				with perfect organization!	
0x88a9	0x98	Gruz		If you're hungry or something...	mp_0112 0x872f
				You've been asking me things	
				like that for a long time.	
0x891f	0x98	Gruz		Anyway, eat plenty of food,	mp_0112 0x8806
				gain plenty of strength, and handle it	
				with perfect organization!	
0x89d6	0x98	Gruz		Wahaha,	
				My new menu this time	
				turned out better than expected.	
0x8a32	0x98	Gruz		I'll rely on you when it's again	
				time for my new menu, you two!	
0x8af7	0x98	Gruz		Due to the influence of the abnormal	
				weather, it's been difficult to stock	
				ingredients lately.	
0x8b73	0x98	Gruz		The village harvest has been	
				sluggish, and the repertoire of	
				recipes I'm able to make is dwindling.	
0x8bf4	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, this isn't a good situation.	
				especially at a time like this, I want to	
				treat everyone to a dish that will give them vitality.	
0x8cbc	0x98	Gruz		Especially at a time like this, I want to	
				treat everyone to a dish that will give	
				them vitality	
0x8d39	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, if I only had ingredients...	
0x8dfb	0x98	Gruz		Fairy...	
				No, allow me to call you	
				little Noi.	
0x8e46	0x98	Gruz		I can see that you're	
				not a bad person at all.	
				I've got to be more bold.	
0x8eac	0x98	Gruz		Please feel free to come	
				here whenever you like.	
				At that time, I'll treat you.	
0x8f40	0x98	Gruz		Anytime you are hungry,	
				that is.	
0x8f7f	0x98	Gruz		Little Noi, please feel free to	
				come here anytime.	
				At that time, I'll treat you.	
0x9023	0x98	Gruz		The fact that that girl	
				was taken is outrageous.	
0x9072	0x98	Gruz		But, if you asked us if we had	
				the power to protect her, I'd	
				hold my tongue...	
0x90de	0x98	Gruz		Man, how pathetic...	
0x913a	0x98	Gruz		Why couldn't I hold my	
				own against that annoying guy...	
0x9190	0x98	Gruz		Man, how pathetic...	mp_0112 0x90de
0x91e0	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, I'm finishing up a dish	
				now and my hands aren't free...	
0x923b	0x98	Gruz		Strange pepper...What is that?	
				Please wait a moment.	
0x92c2	0x98	Gruz		When I was making my new medicinal	
				dish, a silver-haired girl came along.	
0x932a	0x98	Gruz		When I tried offering her food,	
				she said it looked delicious	
				and ate it.	
0x9390	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, it seems this	
				dish is complete!	
				Gahahaha...	
0x93de	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9410	0x98	ALTO		(To do something like eat Gruz's	
				 new menu, you're amazing	
				 Kureha...)	
0x949c	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, thanks to that girl,	
				the dish is complete!	
0x94ea	0x98	Gruz		Gahaha, since it's rare,	
				I'm going to have that girl help me	
				with sampling food from now on!	
0x959a	0x98	Gruz		Now, I've got to think of a plan	
				that will let islanders recover	
				from any kind of illness.	
0x9612	0x98	Gruz		Best would be dishes that give	
				nutrition and boost immunity.	
0x966d	0x98	Gruz		...Alright, I'll think up a new	
				medicinal dish!	
0x96e3	0x98	Gruz		Alright, now that I've decided that,	
				I've got to immediately start	
				developing my new menu.	
0x975b	0x98	Gruz		Just you wait. I've got to think of	
				a dish that will blow away any	
				kind of illness!	
0x97cc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9834	0x98	Gruz		Eartha...	
				I can't believe she collapsed.	
0x987b	0x98	Gruz		I felt like she wasn't very	
				energetic a little while ago, but...	
				I never realized.	
0x98eb	0x98	Gruz		If I had realized, I would have	
				helped with her nutrition...	
				Ooh, I'm worthless.	
0x9981	0x98	Gruz		Eartha...	
				I felt like she wasn't very	
				energetic a little while ago, but...	
0x99e9	0x98	Gruz		If I had realized, I would have	
				helped with her nutrition...	
0x9a7a	0x98	Gruz		Even so, I admire	
				Eartha's work.	
0x9ab9	0x98	Gruz		She is doing splendidly at the	
				Star Shard observation work	
				her mother originally did.	
0x9b2c	0x98	Gruz		She was able to learn from her	
				mother by watching, even though	
				the work is not that simple.	
0x9ba5	0x98	Gruz		She has the reputation of being	
				skilled. You must be proud,	
				Nayuta.	
0x9c06	0x98	ALTO		Ahahahaha...	
0x9c5a	0x98	Gruz		Eartha helps out with the shop	
				sometimes.	
				To me, she is like family.	
0x9cbc	0x98	Gruz		She is beautiful and a hard worker.	
				Wahaha...I'm proud too.	
0x9d4c	0x98	Gruz		I have been the head chef of a	
				high class restaurant on	
				Saint Cerize.	
0x9daf	0x98	Gruz		It's been 40 years since I became	
				a cook... You could say I lived a straight	
				path on the road of food.	
0x9e33	0x98	Gruz		There is no way that the food I	
				make won't be delicious!	
				Don't you think so too, little Nayuta?	
0x9eb0	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9ee2	0x98	ALTO		U-Umm, that's right...	
0x9f18	0x98	ALTO		(You can't say that about the strange	
				 creative cuisine he challenges me	
				 to once in a while...)	
0x9fd0	0x98	Gruz		It's been 40 years since I became a cook...	
				I've lived the path of the cook.	
0xa03b	0x98	Gruz		There is no way that the food I	mp_0112 0x9e33
				make won't be delicious!	
				Don't you think so too, little Nayuta?	
0xa0e0	0x98	Gruz		There is no way that the food I	
				make won't be delicious!	
0xa137	0x98	Gruz		Therefore, you could say the pursuit	
				of new dishes is my mission!	
0xa1cd	0x98	Gruz		Hmm...	
				Due to that crash the salt and pepper	
				got into each other's bottles...	
0xa238	0x98	Gruz		...I'll try to finish for now.	
				A new door of flavor might	
				unexpectedly open.

				How have you been?	
0xa540	0x98	ALTO		You too, Gruz...	
				Say, what is that smell!?	
0xa589	0x98	ALTO		Somehow from that frypan, a strange	
				smell that is sweet, bitter, spicy and	
				sour is emanating...	
0xa606	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, I was just thinking of	
				my next menu!	
0xa64e	0x98	Gruz		Please little Nayuta,	
				since you're here,	
				want to sample it?	
0xa6a7	0x98	ALTO		U-Umm..	
0xa6ce	0x98	ALTO		(I've sampled Gruz's new menus	
				 before many times, but each one	
				 is a bitter experience...)	
0xa747	0x98	ALTO		...I'm full right now,	
				so I'll pass.	
0xa78a	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, is that so?	
				Too bad then.	
0xa7c7	0x98	Gruz		Well, before long,	
				I'll have you help me	
				with my new menu.	
0xa81f	0x98	Gruz		I'm looking forward to it,

0xa9a2	0x98	Gruz		Lyra is at the age where if	
				I ask her to sample my food,	
				she won't do it.	
0xaa09	0x98	Gruz		Mr. Barton has his own work	
				to do, and I can't take up	
				his time like that.	
0xaa71	0x98	Gruz		Among everyone, little Nayuta and little	
				Cygna are good eaters and have returned...	
				I should put this chance to good use.	
0xab08	0x98	Gruz		I've been asking little Nayuta and little Cygna	
				to sample my new menus since they were children.	
				I'm looking forward to working with you again!	
0xabdd	0x98	Gruz		There's no opportunities to invite Lyra

0xac56	0x98	Gruz		Before long, I'll ask for your help.

0xada4	0x98	NOI		I think I shouldn't scare everyone

0xae00	0x98	Gruz		No, I have to apologize for

				yet.	
0xae5a	0x98	Gruz		I can see you're not

				You should be a little more bold.	
0xaebc	0x98	Gruz		...That's right, as a token of our

talk_Antlia
0xb078	0x98	Antlia		Now then, let's get	
				down to business, shall we?	
0xb0c8	0x98	Antlia		Today I intend to request a new	
				Star Shard from Eartha.	
0xb122	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, I wonder what kind of	
				scenery it will be...	
				I too am looking forward to it.	
0xb1b7	0x98	Antlia		Just earlier, it seems Reticul	
				and Cetus arrived on the island.	
0xb217	0x98	Antlia		Goodness, I reunited with them again	
				on this island. These too are the	
				ties between parent and child.	
0xb29c	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, since it's a rare chance,	
				I'll have them tell me tales	
				of their travels.	
0xb332	0x98	Antlia		Just earlier, it seems Reticul	mp_0112 0xb1b7
				and Cetus arrived on the island.	
0xb392	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, since it's a rare chance,	mp_0112 0xb29c
				I'll have them tell me tales	
				of their travels.	
0xb438	0x98	Antlia		Since the incident a year ago,	
				it's become steadily more	
				difficult to obtain Star Shards.	
0xb4b3	0x98	Antlia		Now that their source, Lost Heaven,	
				has left, it cannot be helped...	
0xb51a	0x98	Antlia		At least, we should handle	
				carefully the existing Shards.	
0xb59e	0x98	Antlia		As for that those beautiful Star	
				Shards have become difficult to	
				obtain, it is a lonely thing...	
0xb620	0x98	Antlia		At least, we should handle	mp_0112 0xb51a
				carefully the existing Shards.	
0xb6b2	0x98	Antlia		The world that is reflected in the	
				Star Shards has long been the	
				aspiration of people.	
0xb728	0x98	Antlia		That now, this world is on the brink	
				of disaster due to that world...	
				It's a cynical story.	
0xb7a3	0x98	Antlia		Even so, we must live	
				with all our might.	
				For our precious families too...	
0xb835	0x98	Antlia		That our world is on the brink	
				of disaster due to that beautiful	
				world...	
0xb89e	0x98	Antlia		Even so, we must live	mp_0112 0xb7a3
				with all our might.	
				For our precious families too...	
0xb93e	0x98	Antlia		Now that the ferry runs less often	
				due to abnormalities, goods	
				shortages are occurring everywhere.	
0xb9c0	0x98	Antlia		Especially now, you can say us	
				merchants are showing our skill.	
0xba20	0x98	Antlia		We will predict conditions, deliver	
				goods quickly and relieve the chaos.	
				Huhu, I'm going to be busy.	
0xbacc	0x98	Antlia		Now that's there's worry of goods shortage	
				everywhere, us merchants are showing	
				our skill.	
0xbb46	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, I'm going to be busy.	
				from now on.	
0xbbdf	0x98	Antlia		These abnormalities are throughout the	
				Ciencia Sea... No, they are occurring	
				equally throughout the world.	
0xbc69	0x98	Antlia		It seems there's confusion everywhere.	
				I myself do not know the details, but...	
0xbcd9	0x98	Antlia		Anyhow, I'm relieved	
				that you're safe.	
				I must thank heaven.	
0xbd5c	0x98	Antlia		While you were in bed,	
				we were terribly worried.	
0xbdad	0x98	Antlia		Anyhow, thank goodness you're safe.	
				I must thank heaven for this good luck.	
0xbe96	0x98	Antlia		According to Reticul,	
				I'll have to think about	
				dry goods, but...	
0xbef6	0x98	Antlia		The abnormalities occurred,	
				and I realized I was worried	
				from the start.	
0xbf5e	0x98	Antlia		Because she is irresponsible,	
				I will discuss various things	
				with her while she is here.	
0xbffd	0x98	Antlia		Originally, Reticul brought out	
				the source of our disagreement.	
0xc05d	0x98	Antlia		Because she is irresponsible,	mp_0112 0xbf5e
				I will discuss various things	
				with her while she is here.	
0xc10e	0x98	Antlia		I can't believe that an incident like	
				this occurred on a peaceful island	
				like this...	
0xc183	0x98	Antlia		Fortunately myself and Ursamina	
				were not hurt, but there was a	
				girl that was kidnapped.	
0xc1fa	0x98	Antlia		Though Ursamina, who is the same age,	
				was not also taken, I hope she is safe...	
0xc292	0x98	Antlia		Because I have been visiting this	
				island for 10 years already, I	
				was truly shocked...	
0xc307	0x98	Antlia		I hope the girl who was taken is safe...	
0xc3a1	0x98	Antlia		It seems Eartha's condition has	
				calmed down. I've decided to	
				leave on the next ship.	
0xc415	0x98	Antlia		Nayuta, take care	
				of your sister.	
0xc457	0x98	ALTO		Yes, take care.	
0xc4ae	0x98	Antlia		It seems Eartha's condition has	mp_0112 0xc3a1
				calmed down. I've decided to	
				leave on the next ship.	
0xc522	0x98	Antlia		I'm looking forward to seeing	
				her better when next I	
				see her.	
0xc5b5	0x98	Antlia		That Hell Fever was cured...	
				No, no, I can't believe it.	
0xc60e	0x98	Antlia		What's more, that you were able	
				to find that extinct plant...	
				I can only think it's my imagination.	
0xc691	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, you're a strange child.	
0xc6f8	0x98	Antlia		That you were able	
				to find that extinct plant...	
				I can only think it's my imagination.	
0xc76e	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, you're a strange child.	mp_0112 0xc691
0xc7e3	0x98	Antlia		Eartha suddenly collapsed...	
0xc821	0x98	Antlia		She supports me with my work.	
				I'll go for a sick visit later.	
0xc8a7	0x98	Antlia		Hmm...I wonder if it's	
				a kind of chronic disease.	
0xc8f9	0x98	Antlia		Anyhow, I intend to ask about it later.	
				I must prepare goods for the sick	
				visit...	
0xc9a1	0x98	Antlia		Hmm, I wonder why	
				Ursamina did that...	
0xc9e8	0x98	Antlia		She suddenly spurted a selfish	
				thing that I only just heard the first of.	
				Somehow this situation is strange...	
0xcab2	0x98	Antlia		Oh, if it isn't Nayuta.	
0xcaeb	0x98	Antlia		The truth is, I've got some things to do.	
				I plan to stay on this island for two or	
				three days.	
0xcb9f	0x98	Antlia		Now then, I'm stocking a new	
				Star Shard so I have to be going.	
0xcc00	0x98	Antlia		As for the ferry's departure...	
				Hmm, it seems there's still time.	
0xcc8a	0x98	Antlia		When my work is finished,	
				I'll be going.	
0xccd3	0x98	Antlia		Again for a little while I plan to ask.	
				Thank you for that edge.	
0xcd6a	0x98	Antlia		Ah, I was surprised.	
0xcda0	0x98	Antlia		Though this is Remnant Island where	
				ruins fall several times a year, this	
				is the first time for that kind of shock.	
0xce33	0x98	Antlia		There have been hardly any like that	
				that have fallen on the island until now...	
				As expected, I'm anxious.	
0xcee5	0x98	Antlia		Though this is Remnant Island where	mp_0112 0xcda0
				ruins fall several times a year, this	
				is the first time for that kind of shock.	
0xcf78	0x98	Antlia		As expected, I'm anxious.	
0xcfe9	0x98	Antlia		Oh, if it isn't Nayuta...	
				It's been awhile.	
0xd035	0x98	ALTO		Ah, trader Antlia.	
				You've come.	
0xd073	0x98	Antlia		Yes, I've come to ask your sister	
				to analyze a Star Shard that	
				I've obtained.	
0xd0e2	0x98	Antlia		I came here last night.	
				There's a bit of time	
				until our meeting.	
0xd142	0x98	ALTO		Is that so.	
0xd16d	0x98	ALTO		If it is that Star Shard you're talking	
				about, even I have looked inside. It showed	
				a very mysterious and beautiful scene.	
0xd207	0x98	ALTO		Eartha says it is a	
				"very good one."	
0xd24a	0x98	Antlia		Oh, really?	
				Thank you for that story.	
0xd290	0x98	Antlia		Then, I'm looking forward	
				to your sister coming.	
0xd31b	0x98	Antlia		Star Shards are a type of crystal found in	
				the Ciencia Sea in which have the property	
				of projecting mysterious scenery.	
0xd3b4	0x98	Antlia		A scene of the so-called Lost Heaven.	
0xd3fd	0x98	Antlia		The scenes projected in each "Shard" are	
				all different, and their transactional	
				value changes accordingly.	
0xd487	0x98	Antlia		Also, the process for viewing each	
				scene is slightly different,	
				so first is to check it.	
0xd4ff	0x98	Antlia		That is why I'm requesting Eartha's	
				"Star Shard Observer" analysis.	
0xd563	0x98	Antlia		Even though she is still young,	
				her work is thorough and	
				she always helps me.	
0xd5f8	0x98	Antlia		Star Shards are mysterious crystals	
				found in the Ciencia Sea, and they are	
				popular among nobles and collectors.	
0xd689	0x98	Antlia		Remnant Island produces these "Shards"	
				and a skilled Star Shard Observer	
				is present too, which helps me out.	
0xd717	0x98	Antlia		Huhu, your sister provides a	
				"Shard" sketch as a bonus...	
				I'm looking forward to that, too.	
talk_Antlia_and_Cetus
0xd7d2	0x98	Antlia		Thank goodness I was	
				able to safely reunite	
				with you two.	
0xd82b	0x98	Antlia		On top of the fact that that girl hasn't contacted	
				me since she left home, these abnormalities...	
				I was truly worried.	
0xd8c1	0x98	Cetus		I'm sorry uncle,	
				I should have thought to take	
				Reticul with me.	
0xd91f	0x98	Cetus		Though she is always indirectly	
				saying she will return,	
				that one is pretty stubborn...	
0xd994	0x98	Antlia		No, no, on the contrary,	
				you are looking after	
				that tomboy for me.	
0xd9f6	0x98	Antlia		Originally we had an argument...	
0xda38	0x98	Antlia		Because she is irresponsible,	mp_0112 0xbf5e
				I will discuss various things	
				with her while she is here.	
talk_Ursaminor
0xdb65	0x98	Ursaminor		...Since the other day,	
				I have been helping with	
				father's work, too.	
0xdbcc	0x98	Ursaminor		It's troubling because I remember	
				so many things about him...	
				But I don't think that's bad.	
0xdc4a	0x98	Ursaminor		Since he bought goods from	
				me, somehow, I'm happy.	
0xdcc8	0x98	Ursaminor		...Since the other day,	mp_0112 0xdb65
				I have been helping with	
				father's work, too.	
0xdd2f	0x98	Ursaminor		Though it's troubling...I don't think it's bad.	
				Before long, we will sell you something	
				good.	
0xddd5	0x98	Ursaminor		Even today, my sister is adventuring	
				somewhere in the Ciencia Sea...	
0xde3d	0x98	Ursaminor		Just thinking about that gives	
				me courage.	
0xde8b	0x98	Ursaminor		Huhu, we've both got to	
				do our best today.	
0xdf01	0x98	Ursaminor		When I think that my sister is	
				somewhere in the Ciencia Sea,	
				somehow, it gives me courage.	
0xdf7e	0x98	Ursaminor		Huhu, we've both got to	mp_0112 0xde8b
				do our best today.	
0xe01e	0x98	Ursaminor		With father, I'm stocking goods	
				for the orders this time.	
0xe07b	0x98	Ursaminor		...At a time like this, the islanders	
				must have various things to do, too.	
0xe0e9	0x98	Ursaminor		If you want something, tell me.	
				We'll stock it for you.	
0xe16c	0x98	Ursaminor		I'm stocking the goods	
				for the villagers' orders.	
0xe1c1	0x98	Ursaminor		Will you tell me	
				if you want something?	
0xe232	0x98	Ursaminor		I finally reunited with my sister...	
0xe27b	0x98	Ursaminor		If I can leave peacefully with	
				those that are important to	
				me, that is enough.	
0xe2ec	0x98	Ursaminor		I will do anything to	
				contribute to that.	
0xe361	0x98	Ursaminor		If I can live with father and	
				sister in peace,	
				that is enough.	
0xe3c2	0x98	Ursaminor		I will do my best	
				to contribute to that.	
0xe446	0x98	Ursaminor		...It seemed troubling.	
0xe482	0x98	Ursaminor		Though this place is troubling too...	
				...It might not be on your level.	
0xe4ed	0x98	Ursaminor		Anyway, will you take it easy?	
				Everyone is worried about you.	
0xe576	0x98	Ursaminor		Because it's a time like this,	
				father seems very busy...	
0xe5d2	0x98	Ursaminor		...It is difficult for us, too.	
0xe64c	0x98	Ursaminor		Something may be happening	
				on this sea...	
0xe699	0x98	Ursaminor		I hope sister is all right, but...	
0xe708	0x98	Ursaminor		I hope sister is all right, but...	mp_0112 0xe699
0xe76b	0x98	Ursaminor		...I've got to collect my bags.	
0xe7af	0x98	Ursaminor		I wonder where father will go next.	
0xe811	0x98	Ursaminor		...Thank goodness.	
0xe848	0x98	Ursaminor		I'll sick visit	
				with father.	
0xe8a2	0x98	Ursaminor		...I tried to come help with father's work...	
				...But as expected...	
0xe909	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew...	
0xe952	0x98	ALTO		(Ursamina is always thinking of	
				 thing by herself.)	
0xe9a4	0x98	ALTO		(I wonder if there's some	
				 reason behind it...)	
0xea46	0x98	Ursaminor		...That surprised me.	
				What was that quake just now?	
0xeac0	0x98	Ursaminor		...Ah...	mp_0001 0xd6a4
0xeaed	0x98	Ursaminor		...The orange juice spilled...	
0xeb69	0x98	Ursaminor		...That surprised me...	
0xebb6	0x98	Ursaminor		...The orange juice...	
0xec27	0x98	Ursaminor		..................	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0xec6f	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew.	mp_0004n 0x1b99
0xec9c	0x98	ALTO		(Umm, this girl is, Antlia's	
				 daughter Ursamina...	
				 wasn't she?)	
0xecfa	0x98	ALTO		(She seems shy,	
				 and I don't see her talking	
				 with others much.)	
0xed7b	0x98	Ursaminor		...I'm not shy.	
				You're not thinking	
				of politeness.	
0xede1	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xee13	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry.	
				(She brought out her face...)	
0xee92	0x98	Ursaminor		..................	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0xeec9	0x98	Ursaminor		...Do you need something? I'm busy.	
0xef39	0x98	Ursaminor		..................	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0xef81	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew.	mp_0004n 0x1b99
talk_Camelope
0xeff6	0x98	Camelope		Now then...Now that I've had a rest,	
				I will go see that girl's way of life.	
0xf064	0x98	Camelope		Running from the traditional Camelope family	
				and hiding on this kind of remote island...	
				preposterous.	
0xf0ec	0x98	Camelope		I'll take her with me quickly,	
				and return to the head family.	
0xf174	0x98	Camelope		Good grief, when it comes to that girl...	
				She ran from the traditional Camelope family	
				and hid on this kind of remote island.	
0xf213	0x98	Camelope		I'll take her with me quickly,	mp_0112 0xf0ec
				and return to the head family.	
0xf2af	0x98	Camelope		I confirmed Sasha's feelings and	
				I feel like I got a load off my chest, too.	
0xf31e	0x98	Camelope		Calm down and discuss...	
				Though that's all that's needed,	
				it's a pointless waste of time.	
0xf399	0x98	Camelope		From now on, I must cool my	
				head a little more.	
0xf427	0x98	Camelope		Two years have passed since	
				Sasha left the estate...	
0xf47e	0x98	Camelope		If that girl is happy with her	
				way of life, then I do not	
				intend to interfere.	
0xf4ee	0x98	Camelope		However, if she is merely	
				getting along, hiding on a	
				remote island like this, then...	
0xf565	0x98	Camelope		...As expected, that girl is still a child.	
				She must return to the estate once.	
0xf5ff	0x98	Camelope		Since that girl is still a child,	
				I must bring her back to the	
				estate.	
0xf667	0x98	Camelope		...Furthermore, though I tried to	
				convince her of that, it turned	
				into an argument.	
0xf6e8	0x98	Camelope		My...	
				I wonder where Norma has gone off to.	
0xf736	0x98	Camelope		Good grief...	
				To leave the side of her master...	
				She must be reminded that she is a maid.	
0xf7e7	0x98	Camelope		Even though I came specifically	
				to this remote island...	
0xf842	0x98	Camelope		When it comes to that girl, she's become	
				even more of a tomboy than before she	
				ran from home.	
0xf8c1	0x98	Camelope		I want her to awaken as the daughter	
				of the high-class Camelope family.	
0xf953	0x98	Camelope		When it comes to that girl, she's become	mp_0112 0xf842
				even more of a tomboy than before she	
				ran from home.	
0xf9d2	0x98	Camelope		I want her to awaken as the daughter	mp_0112 0xf8c1

talk_Norma
0xfa6a	0x98	Norma		(Milady...	
				 I hope she is well.)	
0xfaaa	0x98	Norma		(Ooh, the lady of the house came.	
				 Surely she'll become angry...)	
0xfb45	0x98	Norma		The lady of the house and milady	
				had a peaceful conversation even	
				after that fragrance wore off.	
0xfbc4	0x98	Norma		The discord of many years was	
				solved, and I too am feeling	
				relieved.	
0xfc27	0x98	Norma		Nayuta, truly,	
				thank you very much.	
0xfca0	0x98	Norma		Ooh, as I thought,	
				milady became angry...	
0xfce9	0x98	Norma		It was the natural thing, without contacting me,	
				she suddenly ran away from her parents'	
				home, so I visited her here.	
0xfd7d	0x98	Norma		Ah, my heart is troubled.	
0xfdb7	0x98	Norma		I wonder if there is a method by which	
				milady and the lady of the house	
				can reconcile their differences...	
0xfe68	0x98	Norma		Ah, my heart is troubled.	mp_0112 0xfd7d
0xfea2	0x98	Norma		I wonder if there is a method by which	mp_0112 0xfdb7

talk_Sculp
0x10002	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta,	mp_0000 0x7935
				I've got something I want you to hear.	
0x10055	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	mp_0000 0x7988
				What in the world is it?	
0x10098	0x98	Sculp		The truth is, I heard this story	mp_0000 0x79cb
				from Antlia recently...	
0x100f0	0x98	Sculp		It seems using fertile "soils"	mp_0000 0x7a23
				will improve crops greatly.	
0x1014a	0x98	Sculp		It's better than manure, and	mp_0000 0x7a7d
				it's pretty popular on the continent.	
0x101ac	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	mp_0000 0x7adf
				I can't find much good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x10224	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, eh?	mp_0000 0x7b57
				I don't think I have any	
				good ideas.	
0x1027d	0x98	ALTO		From the start, Remnant Island soil	mp_0000 0x7bb0
				is full of salt and hard, probably...	
0x102e5	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	mp_0000 0x7c18
				It's probably as you say.	
0x10342	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems I heard an	mp_0000 0x7c75
				impossible story, eh? Sorry,	
				my bad.	
0x1039f	0x98	Sculp		But if you get some good "soil"	mp_0000 0x7cd2
				somewhere, I'd be a help	
				if you could give me some.	
0x10411	0x98	Sculp		Will you keep that in mind	mp_0000 0x7d44
				for me?	
0x10453	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x10480	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile "soil," was it?	mp_0000 0x7db3
				 If I find some, I should try	
				 bringing it to Sculp, right?)	
0x1063c	0x98	Sculp		*cry*...	
				...Ah, that's great!	
				That's great, Nayuta!	
0x1068e	0x98	Sculp		When I heard Eartha had collapsed,	
				I...I...Ooh, *cry*...	
0x106e6	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x10710	0x6B	Axe		Sweatdrop	
0x10757	0x98	Axe		Good grief, a typical drunk.

0x107b7	0x98	ALTO		A-Ahaha...	mp_0111 0xea06
0x10814	0x98	Sculp		Ooh, sorry Nayuta...	
				I'm really glad Eartha	
				was saved....	
0x1086c	0x98	Sculp		*cry*...Thank goodness...	
				Truly, thank goodness...	
0x10928	0x98	Sculp		*cry*...	
				As expected, I'm a drunk.	
				I've got to hold my tongue.	
0x10985	0x98	Sculp		Good grief Axe...	
				You're never careless.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x10a58	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good "soil!?"	
0x10aac	0x98	Sculp		It is dark, has a soft feel and has a fragrant	mp_0000 0x97a3
				earthy scent... There's no mistake- It is	
				of excellent quality.	
0x10b39	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, the truth is, I found it	mp_0000 0x9830
				someplace...	
0x10b83	0x98	ALTO		That's right, if it's alright with you,	
				can I give it to you?	
0x10c0e	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	mp_0000 0x9907
0x10c43	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	mp_0000 0x993c
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x10cbe	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha of the general	mp_0000 0x99b7
				store came to tell me she wants to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x10d38	0x98	Sculp		Because she said she wants to stock	mp_0000 0x9a31
				my vegetables, I'm honored by the request	
				and I thought I would respond to it somehow.	
0x10dd1	0x98	Sculp		Anyhow, you helped me out, Nayuta.	mp_0000 0x9aca
				Please use this well for me.	
0x10e30	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	mp_0000 0x9b29
0x10e6d	0x98	ALTO		If something happens again,	mp_0000 0x9b66
				I won't hesitate to tell you.	
0x10ec5	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, you helped me out.	mp_0000 0x9bbe

0x11209	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, this too is very fertile.	mp_0000 0x9f04

0x11cda	0x98	Sculp		Well, that's why I	
				fell in love with her──	
0x11d26	0x6B	Sculp		Unknown	
0x11d59	0x98	Sculp		Hey, just what are you making me say!?	
0x11da0	0x98	Axe		Haha, don't be shy.	
talk_Axe
0x11eb8	0x98	Axe		...Well for today, I'll congratulate	
				Eartha on her recovery.	
0x11f12	0x98	Axe		That girl has been working and looking	
				after the house since her parents died	
				when she was around 15.	
0x11f94	0x98	Axe		That girl has had it harder than us.	
				What would we do if we couldn't	
				save her?	
0x12027	0x98	Axe		Good grief, with this I can finally fish	
				without reservation.	
0x12082	0x98	Axe		Carina said she would pray...	
				I've got to get prepared.	
0x12141	0x98	Axe		That reminds me, some guys	
				near the port made a	
				"museum."	
0x12197	0x98	Axe		They look like they're from	
				the Empire. Somehow, they	
				seem unusually interesting.	
0x12205	0x98	Axe		Vel should be happy. I should	
				bring her with me soon.	
talk_Hydol
0x122a0	0x98	Hydol		It is time for my regular doctor's round,	
				so please come again.	
0x122ff	0x98	Hydol		That's right...The truth is,	
				I have some news for you.	
0x12355	0x98	Hydol		The thought extinct Yupina Grass	
				was found blooming in a certain	
				mountain region.	
0x123c5	0x98	Hydol		Now that the abnormalities have	
				ceased, the symptoms of Hell Fever	
				patients throughout the world are improving.	
0x12453	0x98	Hydol		With this, the remaining patients should	
				be able to be treated. What a fortunate	
				thing.	
0x124f1	0x98	Hydol		The thought extinct Yupina Grass was	
				found and it's said that the remaining Hell	
				Fever patients will be able to be treated.	
0x1258b	0x98	Hydol		Though it doesn't seem like that	
				much Yupina Grass was found...	
0x125ea	0x98	Hydol		This time for sure, we must take care	
				not to let it become extinct again.	
0x12689	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta...	
				It seems you've finally awakened.	
				Truly, thank goodness.	
0x126ea	0x98	ALTO		Dr. Hydol...	
				You've returned to the island.	
0x12734	0x98	Hydol		Yes, I returned to Saint Cerize,	
				but a few days ago, I was notified that	
				you drifted ashore unconscious.	
0x127bb	0x98	Hydol		Everywhere is in chaos, when I came to	
				the island there's rubble everywhere, a	
				fairytale fairy even exists...	
0x12847	0x98	Hydol		Somehow, I myself can't believe	
				the current situation.	
0x1289d	0x98	NOI		S-Sorry for	
				startling you...	
0x128d7	0x98	Hydol		No, don't worry about it.	
				For now, it appears	
				you're in no danger.	
0x12938	0x98	Hydol		Though I'm a bit confused myself...	
				As a doctor, I must do	
				my work properly.	
0x129a3	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta and Noi, you should	
				rest your minds and bodies too.	
0x12a37	0x98	Hydol		Abnormalities are occurring throughout the world...	
				This is the state of this Ciencia Sea.	
0x12ab1	0x98	Hydol		Ferry travel has been restricted,	
				and I plan to stay here awhile	
				longer.	
0x12b18	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta and Noi, take it easy	
				and rest your minds and bodies.	
0x12b9c	0x98	Hydol		While I am staying here,	
				I plan to execute my work	
				as a doctor properly.	
0x12c03	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta and Noi, take it easy	mp_0112 0x12b18
				and rest your minds and bodies.	
0x12c95	0x98	Hydol		Eartha should continue to get	
				better from this point on.	
0x12ced	0x98	Hydol		Though I will continue to check on her progress	
				to make sure, there is no longer a need to fear	
				the "Hell Fever" symptoms.	
0x12d86	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...thank goodness.	mp_0005c 0x5567
0x12dc2	0x98	ALTO		Dr. Hydol, you really helped	
				me out this time.	
0x12e0f	0x98	Hydol		Ah, I didn't do anything special.	
0x12e51	0x98	Hydol		Everything is thanks to the fact	
				that you were able to bring me	
				the "Yupina Grass."	
0x12ec3	0x98	Hydol		This may have been due to a	
				miracle brought forth by feelings	
				for family.	
0x12f65	0x98	Hydol		Due to the effect of the "Yupina Grass,"	
				Eartha should get better and	
				better from this point on.	
0x12fe4	0x98	Hydol		Though I will continue to check on her progress	mp_0112 0x12ced
				to make sure, there is no longer a need to fear	
				the "Hell Fever" symptoms.	
0x1307d	0x98	Hydol		This may have been due to a	mp_0112 0x12ec3
				miracle brought forth by feelings	
				for family.	
0x1310d	0x98	Hydol		Before long, I plan to board the	
				ferry bound for Saint Cerize.	
0x1316b	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta, please take care	
				of your sister from here on.	
0x131fc	0x98	Hydol		Thank you for helping me	
				with my work.	
				You've been a big help.	
0x13259	0x98	Hydol		If you are not feeling well,	
				please come here anytime.	
0x132af	0x98	Hydol		I plan to stay for a little	
				while longer. I will	
				examine them immediately.	
0x13351	0x98	Hydol		I am still sorting out the patient charts.	
				I think I will begin the exams soon.	
0x133c0	0x98	Hydol		I can't keep the patients waiting	
				very long, but...	
0x13413	0x98	Hydol		Anyhow, my plans are complete,	
				and I will ask the elder about it.	
0x134ba	0x98	Hydol		No, no, the air and beautiful	
				scenery of this village	
				have truly healed me.	
0x13524	0x98	Hydol		I am also looking forward to	
				the medical exams in the	
				coming days.	
0x135dc	0x98	Hydol		Umm, for now, I will greet	
				the elder, then...	
0x13629	0x98	Hydol		...Hmm, but I'm troubled...	
				What will I do today...?	
0x13697	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x136c9	0x98	ALTO		(I wonder if something happened	
				 to Dr. Hydol.)	
0x13717	0x98	ALTO		(...Maybe I should come	
				 check on him later?)	
talk_Dorado
0x137b5	0x98	Dorado		Even so, Eartha...	
				Truly, thank goodness she was saved.	
0x1380d	0x98	Dorado		Though it's said the beautiful die young,	
				as expected, the beautiful must live	
				a long life.	
0x13888	0x98	Dorado		Remnant Island's...	
				No, the Ciencia Sea's loss!	
0x13900	0x98	Dorado		Though it's said the beautiful die young,	mp_0112 0x1380d
				as expected, the beautiful must live	
				a long life.	
0x1397b	0x98	Dorado		Remnant Island's...	mp_0112 0x13888
				No, the Ciencia Sea's loss!	
talk_Mensa
0x13a2b	0x98	Mensa		We are searching for a certain	
				person around the Ciencia Sea.	
0x13a88	0x98	Mensa		According to our information,	
				it is highly likely that he is	
				on this island, but...	
0x13afa	0x98	Mensa		...Phew, we are	
				very troubled.	
0x13b60	0x98	Mensa		We are searching for a certain	mp_0112 0x13a2b
				person around the Ciencia Sea.	
0x13bbd	0x98	Mensa		If we don't find him quickly...	
				We are very troubled.	
0x13c38	0x98	Mensa		Huhu, this time, we have	
				officially come here as tourists.	
0x13c92	0x98	Mensa		It has been awhile since Michey	
				came to this island, so he made	
				time expressly to come.	
0x13d08	0x98	Mensa		Just now, Ophiuchus went	
				to take him for a walk, but...	
0x13d5f	0x98	Mensa		...He hasn't returned for awhile.	
				I wonder where he has gone.	
0x13de4	0x98	Mensa		Michey and Ophiuchus have	
				gone for a walk, but...	
0x13e35	0x98	Mensa		...Huhu, if he has escaped again,	
				as you'd expect, all I can do is	
				laugh.	
0x13ed5	0x98	Mensa		Though this is a situation where	
				I don't know what will happen to the world...	
				Even if we panic, nothing will change.	
0x13f69	0x98	Mensa		Especially at this kind of time,	
				we must make preparations.	
0x13fc4	0x98	Mensa		Huhu, it seems	
				you understand that.	
0x1402f	0x98	Mensa		Especially at this kind of time,	mp_0112 0x13f69
				we must make preparations.	
0x1408a	0x98	Mensa		Huhu, it seems	mp_0112 0x13fc4
				you understand that.	
0x14103	0x98	Mensa		It looks like Michey is	
				going here and there	
				on this island.	
0x1415e	0x98	Mensa		He too cannot calm down	
				in this situation.	
0x141a8	0x98	Mensa		Until we return to the estate,	
				Ophiuchus will properly	
				look after him.	
0x14235	0x98	Mensa		In this situation, Michey	
				too cannot calm himself.	
0x14287	0x98	Mensa		Until we return to the estate,	mp_0112 0x141a8
				Ophiuchus will properly	
				look after him.	
0x14322	0x98	Mensa		Because of the current situation,	
				even the ferry leaves rarely.	
0x14381	0x98	Mensa		There is also the hint of battle...	
				It seems staying on this	
				island would be safer.	
0x143f3	0x98	Mensa		In order to safely return	
				Michey to the estate too,	
				we must move carefully.	
0x14485	0x98	Mensa		Abnormal weather is occurring.	
				I am becoming concerned over	
				the territory Michey will inherit.	
0x14502	0x98	Mensa		I must contact the trader and	
				have him preserve it as much	
				as possible.	
0x145be	0x98	Mensa		Before he died, the millionaire	
				invested hardly any Mira into	
				his land.	
0x14624	0x98	Mensa		As for the inheritance,	
				we must make the "land"	
				verdant for him.	
0x14683	0x98	Mensa		As for the relatives of the millionaire,	
				it seems they had a plan to sell	
				him out, but...	
0x146fb	0x98	Mensa		Huhu, now that we have found	
				Michey like this, they are	
				unable to do whatever the like.	
0x14799	0x98	Mensa		After finding Michey, the millionaire	
				wanted us to look after his land	
				and support the inheritance.	
0x1481b	0x98	Mensa		Well, though it will be difficult...	
				Because he has requested it,	
				we must see it through to the end.	
0x148c4	0x98	Mensa		Hmm...	
				Just with all this commotion,	
				we cannot find him...	
0x1491d	0x98	Mensa		It is possible that he is	
				no longer on this island.	
0x14970	0x98	Mensa		We should think of searching	
				in other locations as well.	
0x149f0	0x98	Mensa		It is possible that he is	mp_0112 0x1491d
				no longer on this island.	
0x14a43	0x98	Mensa		We should think of searching	mp_0112 0x14970
				in other locations as well.	
0x14aef	0x98	Mensa		...Ophiuchus, "he" will	
				be fine in the cold.	
0x14b3b	0x98	Ophiuchus		Yes, there should be no problem,	
				now that I remember.	
0x14b94	0x98	Ophiuchus		However, the climate is abnormal,	
				and I can say nothing...	
0x14bf2	0x98	Mensa		Somehow, it seems we need to hurry.	
0x14c7c	0x98	Mensa		Somehow, it seems strange things	
				have begun occurring...	
0x14cd4	0x98	Mensa		Somehow, it seems we need to hurry.	mp_0112 0x14bf2
0x14d6a	0x98	Mensa		Hmm...We are at a deadlock	
				in the search for "him."	
0x14dbd	0x98	Mensa		Despite the fact the we	
				are on a small island...	
				How careless.	
0x14e1a	0x98	Ophiuchus		Whatever should we do?	
0x14e55	0x98	Mensa		We cannot give up.	
0x14e88	0x98	Mensa		In a situation like this, we	
				must ask for assistance	
				from the islanders...	
0x14f37	0x98	Mensa		Our search for "him"	
				has come to a standstill.	
0x14f85	0x98	Mensa		In a situation like this, we	mp_0112 0x14e88
				must ask for assistance	
				from the islanders...	
talk_Ophiuchus
0x15036	0x98	Ophiuchus		Just where in the world	
				is "that person"...	
0x15085	0x98	Ophiuchus		For our work, too,	
				we must find him.	
0x150f5	0x98	Ophiuchus		We must quickly find	
				"that person."	
0x1513c	0x98	Ophiuchus		It would be nice	
				if there were some clue...	
0x151e1	0x98	Ophiuchus		You, of the Handyman Shop,	
				I truly thank you.	
0x15232	0x98	Ophiuchus		In a situation like this,	
				I cannot take him back	
				to the estate immediately...	
0x152a2	0x98	Ophiuchus		We will politely look after	
				Master Michey.	
0x152fa	0x98	Ophiuchus		In a situation like this,	mp_0112 0x15232
				I cannot take him back	
				to the estate immediately...	
0x1536a	0x98	Ophiuchus		We will politely look after	mp_0112 0x152a2
				Master Michey.	
0x153c4	0x98	Ophiuchus		With the abnormal weather lately...	
				I am worried about the welfare of	
				"that person."	
0x1543b	0x98	Ophiuchus		I hope he is not seriously	
				injured anywhere...	
0x154df	0x98	Mensa		...Ophiuchus, "he" will	mp_0112 0x14aef
				be fine in the cold.	
0x1552b	0x98	Ophiuchus		Yes, there should be no problem,	mp_0112 0x14b3b
				now that I remember.	
0x15584	0x98	Ophiuchus		However, the climate is abnormal,	mp_0112 0x14b94
				and I can say nothing...	
0x155e2	0x98	Mensa		Somehow, it seems you	
				are in a hurry.	
0x1566d	0x98	Ophiuchus		"That person"...	
				I hope he is fine.	
0x15706	0x98	Mensa		Hmm...We are at a deadlock	mp_0112 0x14d6a
				in the search for "him."	
0x15759	0x98	Mensa		Despite the fact the we	mp_0112 0x14dbd
				are on a small island...	
				How careless.	
0x157b6	0x98	Ophiuchus		Whatever should we do?	mp_0112 0x14e1a
0x157f1	0x98	Mensa		We cannot give up.	mp_0112 0x14e55
0x15824	0x98	Mensa		In a situation like this, we	mp_0112 0x14e88

0x158d3	0x98	Ophiuchus		Hmm...You're certainly right.

talk_Victor
0x15c2c	0x98	Victor		I will go speak with Dr. Volans	
				regarding a way to stop the

0x15c9e	0x98	Victor		The ruins that incessantly fall	
				are not weapons, and we	
				need to be certain of that.	
0x15d11	0x98	Victor		Through the prince, we will	
				need to propose something

0x15dac	0x98	Victor		Through the prince, we will	mp_0112 0x15d11
				need to propose something	
				to his majesty the emperor...	
0x15e1f	0x98	Victor		As expected, I'll need to	
				return to the Empire alone...	
0x15eeb	0x98	Victor		If it is Dr. Volans, he should be able	
				to devise a good method to protect	
				the empire against disaster.	
0x15f71	0x98	Victor		I may be useful to him.	
0x15fe0	0x98	Victor		It seems I do not think of the	
				state of affairs in the Empire	
				very often, somehow.	
0x16052	0x98	Victor		...Now that I hear of the state of battle,	
				as one who holds the rank of baron,	
				I may need to return to the Empire...	
0x160e6	0x98	Victor		I think I will remain on this island.	
				There may be something that	
				can only be done here.	
0x16186	0x98	Victor		I think I will remain on this island.	mp_0112 0x160e6
				There may be something that

0x161fe	0x98	Victor		And...my family will be safe

0x16267	0x98	Victor		Good grief...I can't believe that	
				I have become involved in this.	
0x162c9	0x98	Victor		My wife and daughter too.	
				Maybe I should leave the	
				village soon, but...	
0x1636a	0x98	Victor		More importantly, we thought you were	
				obedient like a doll and you thought	
				this much about us...	
0x163ea	0x98	Victor		Understanding that makes me	
				happy more than anything.	
0x1644a	0x98	Victor		If something is happening

0x164a4	0x98	Victor		Yes, it's because you didn't

talk_Victor_and_Pecula
0x1658e	0x98	Victor		From now on, I will discuss things

0x1665f	0x98	Victor		You should try to

0x166a2	0x98	Pecula		Understood...	
				Please be careful.	
0x16767	0x98	Victor		Hey! When you open your mouth,

0x167c4	0x98	Victor		You are the one who said	
				you wanted to come along with me!	
0x1681f	0x98	Pecula		Yes, that's right.	
				I didn't think it'd be this rural.	
0x16875	0x98	Pecula		Notwithstanding the prince's order,	
				leaving the messenger work in

0x168f5	0x98	Pecula		Hmph, at least know your place.	
0x16936	0x98	Victor		W-What are you saying!	
				Just say it again!!	
0x169c7	0x98	Victor		Hey! If you're saying that,	
				I will say that your beautiful face when you	
				were young was your only redeeming feature!	
0x16a5b	0x98	Victor		Now that you have aged, to me,

talk_Pecula
0x16b9c	0x98	Pecula		Up until now, I worried my

				to fighting with my husband.	
0x16c0d	0x98	Pecula		Now that abnormalities are	
				occurring, I must execute

0x16c78	0x98	Pecula		No matter what happens,	
				I will protect this child.	
0x16cf3	0x98	Pecula		Now that abnormalities are	mp_0112 0x16c0d

0x16e25	0x98	Pecula		Please leave Equlea to me.	
0x16e61	0x98	Pecula		You have splendidly

0x16ee0	0x98	Pecula		My husband will think of

0x16f39	0x98	Pecula		I too, for my husband

0x16fb8	0x98	Pecula		I too, for my husband	mp_0112 0x16f39

0x17045	0x98	Pecula		When those scary armor guys

0x18339	0x98	Equlea		Someone in the village has

0x18394	0x98	Equlea		Like this, nothing has changed

0x1898c	0x98	Cetus		Reticul left home, and it's been

0x2673b	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Because Remnant Island

0x27474	0x06	Victor		ANI_WAIT4

0x28fc8	0x98	ALTO		That's right, Antlia.	
0x29041	0x98	ALTO		Though the flowers you should have had	
				mean "repose of soul," what kind of	
				flowers are they?	
0x290db	0x98	Antlia		Yes, though they are starting to be used in	
				the Ciencia Sea, they are popular as	
				offerings throughout the world.	
0x2918b	0x06	Antlia		ANI_SIT1_GESTURE1	
0x291bc	0x98	Antlia		The "Fiona Flower" thrives in the west	
				part of the continent and they have	
				a pure, white color.	
0x2923b	0x98	Antlia		Also, the petals have the property	
				of glowing faintly in the dark. It is	
				a very beautiful sight.	
0x292bb	0x98	Antlia		Unfortunately, it seems they do	
				not grow in the Ciencia Sea...

0x29693	0x98	ALTO		Antlia,	
				thank you for the information.	
0x296f0	0x98	Antlia		No...I'm sorry that this is all the

0x2974c	0x98	Antlia		Please tell the elder that I will

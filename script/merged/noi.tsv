0xad	0x98	NOI		Master Kureha should be	
				in Heliograd.	
0xf0	0x98	NOI		You could say it's the	
				center of <Terra>...	
				This won't be easy.	
0x14c	0x98	NOI		Nayuta, let's be	
				perfectly prepared	
				before we go!	
0x1b4	0x98	NOI		Even I don't know the reason	
				snow started to fall on the island...	
0x214	0x98	NOI		Even though Zext's actions	
				don't have a direct impact on	
				this world...	
0x277	0x98	NOI		...I think we should hurry to	
				<La Worg> temple!	
0x2f8	0x98	NOI		Nayuta, I want you to go	
				check on Master Kureha.	
0x346	0x98	NOI		It looks like she left	
				for the village...	
0x38d	0x98	ALTO		I'm interested in what that Selam	
				guy said too.	
0x3db	0x98	ALTO		Wait here. I'll find her soon.	
0x441	0x98	NOI		I really want to look for Master	
				Kureha myself, but...	
0x495	0x98	NOI		Jeez, it sure is inconvenient not to	
				be able to walk in the village.	
0x513	0x98	NOI		It looks like Master Kureha left	
				for the village...	
0x564	0x98	NOI		I-I wonder if she's alright...	
				But there's no way I can let myself	
				be found by humans...	
0x5d9	0x98	NOI		...Please, Nayuta.	
				If you find Master Kureha, please	
				help her.	
0x668	0x98	NOI		Master Kureha, somehow...	
				I feel she's alive.	
0x6b3	0x98	NOI		I hope she'll regain a few	
				of her memories by staying	
				here...	
0x70d	0x98	ALTO		That's right...	mp_0115 0x172f0
0x73c	0x98	NOI		...Anyway, if it's your sister we're	
				talking about, I can relax and leave	
				everything to her.	
0x7b5	0x98	NOI		Let's resume the exploration	
				of <Terra>, Nayuta!	
0x803	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, we'll find Cygna this time	
				for sure!	
0x874	0x98	NOI		...If it's your sister we're talking about,	
				leave it to me.	
0x8cd	0x98	NOI		I hope you'll regain a few	
				of your memories by staying	
				here...	
0x944	0x98	NOI		Sorry Nayuta, but...	
				I want you to wait a while	
				before the next exploration.	
0x9ad	0x98	NOI		I'm worried about Cygna too, but	
				I'm more worried about Master	
				Kureha right now...	
0xa1c	0x98	NOI		I want you to help me with	
				Master Kureha's depression!	
0xaac	0x98	NOI		Master Kureha! Master Kureha!	
0xb18	0x6B	NOI		Unknown	
0xb49	0x98	NOI		I-It doesn't look like	
				she's over here.	
0xb8e	0x98	NOI		...Please, Nayuta!	
				Search for Master Kureha!!	
0xc2d	0x98	NOI		Ehehe, it's good that	
				we found the resin.	
0xc74	0x98	NOI		This will help both you and	
				your sister...	
0xcbc	0x98	NOI		...N-Nevermind.	mp_3099 0x11ad8
0xd12	0x98	NOI		(Our business is finished.	
				 I should resume the search	
				 for Cygna and Zext.)	
0xd7b	0x98	NOI		(Next is the <Rieseweld> continent...	
				 Let's hurry, Nayuta!)	
0xe6e	0x98	Asa		Here Noi, say	
				aaaaah!	
0xea1	0x98	NOI		A-aaaaah...	
0xecb	0x98	NOI		Gulp...!	
0xef2	0x98	NOI		(munch, munch, munch...)	
0xf29	0x98	NOI		T-This is delicious!	
0xf5c	0x98	NOI		What is this...	
				In my mouth is the sensation of	
				sweet flower nectar!	
0xfbd	0x98	Asa		Hehe, I'm glad	
				you like it.	
0xff6	0x98	Asa		We have plenty more,	
				so eat it and don't	
				hold back.	
0x1046	0x98	NOI		(crunch, crunch...)	
0x1078	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x10a2	0x6B	Lyra		Sweatdrop	
0x10d4	0x98	Lyra		Eartha is really adaptable you know...	
0x111a	0x98	ALTO		(That's Eartha for you...	
				 I never worry about this place.)	
0x11b6	0x98	NOI		Nayuta's sister has	
				excellent technique.	
0x11fc	0x98	NOI		To think you could make something like this from	
				flour... I'm sure she's a meister among humans!	
0x127a	0x98	ALTO		Hahahaha...	
				Even so, you don't have to go THAT far.	
0x12f4	0x98	NOI		Nayuta's sister has	noi 0x11b6
				excellent technique.	
0x133a	0x98	NOI		...Nayuta too...	
				It seems that there's various kinds	
				of people among humans.

0x14b9	0x98	NOI		I-I'm not exactly sure, but...	
				I don't know if anything's happening	
				in <Terra> right now.	
0x152f	0x98	NOI		If you want to search for that	
				animal, let's hurry, Nayuta!	
0x162e	0x98	NOI		Hey, Nayuta!	
				Let's give the "Elumi Resin"	
				to your sister!	
0x168e	0x98	NOI		("Elumi Resin"...	
				 I can probably get it in <Fall>	
				 of <Oltapia>.)	
0x16ed	0x98	NOI		(Let's go search for a tree	
				 growing in a shady place, Nayuta!)

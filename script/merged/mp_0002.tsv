0xc54	0x98	Aulbath		Please give that Star Shard	
				to Cygna when he awakens.	
0xcab	0x98	Aulbath		Even though it will be a happy time...	
				Don't forget that.	
0xd06	0x98	Aulbath		And, if you plan to bring him and Kureha	
				here once again,	
				I plan to give them a warm welcome.	
0xd84	0x98	Aulbath		Though it has been a short time,	
				I work as a substitute for the man	
				called Zext.	
0xdf5	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, please take care of them.	
0xe61	0x98	Aulbath		If you plan to bring Cygna and Kureha	
				here once again, I plan to give them	
				a warm welcome.	
0xedc	0x98	Aulbath		Though it has been a short time,	mp_0002 0xd84
				I work as a substitute for the man	
				called Zext.	
0xf4d	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, we're counting on you.	
0xfb4	0x98	ALTO		That's right...I've got to	
				notify Master.	
0xffc	0x6B	Aulbath		Question	
0x1031	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, what's wrong.	
				Somehow, you seem happy, but...	
0x1088	0x98	ALTO		Yes, the truth is...	
0x10bc	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta explained the general	
				situation to Orvus.	
0x1114	0x6B	Aulbath		Ellipsis	
0x1151	0x98	Aulbath		...Good grief...	
				That stupid son of mine!	
0x119c	0x98	Aulbath		Haha, while I was worrying about	
				you, you were sleeping without	
				a care in the world.	
0x1211	0x98	ALTO		Ahahahaha...	
				I guess that's true.	
0x1251	0x98	Aulbath		...Nayuta, Noi.	
				Please wake him up.	
0x1296	0x98	Aulbath		As the parent who raised him...	
				I must scold him well for his	
				dishonorable actions up until now.	
0x1317	0x98	ALTO		Yes, leave it to me!	mp_0000 0xfbcf
0x134b	0x98	NOI		We'll do our best.	
0x13b6	0x98	Aulbath		The truth is, before long,	
				I will begin fencing classes	
				targeted at the children.	
0x1428	0x98	Aulbath		Once Cygna is awakened,	
				I'll have him help me as a means	
				of repaying his debt to me.	
0x149d	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, Noi.	
				Please take care of him.	
0x150c	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, Noi.	
				Please take care of Cygna.	
0x1555	0x98	Aulbath		As the parent who raised him...	mp_0002 0x1296
				I must scold him well for his	
				dishonorable actions up until now.	
0x160e	0x98	Aulbath		It's been more than one year	
				since Cygna left. It seems like	
				only yesterday.	
0x167b	0x98	Aulbath		Huhu, though he left without saying	
				goodbye...	
				He lacked manners to the end.	
0x16e8	0x98	ALTO		Master...	
0x1711	0x98	Aulbath		...He returned to the place he is from.	
				I think that is fine.	
0x1770	0x98	Aulbath		However, his days	
				as my son were no	
				lie.	
0x17b9	0x98	Aulbath		I do not know when it will happen	
				but, the day when those paths	
				cross will come...	
0x182c	0x98	Aulbath		I am looking forward to that day.	
0x1870	0x98	ALTO		...Yes, that's right.	
0x18cd	0x98	Aulbath		Cygna's days	
				as my son were no	
				lie.	
0x1911	0x98	Aulbath		The days when those paths	
				cross will come...	
				I'm looking forward to it.	
0x1a17	0x98	Aulbath		...Snow...	
				Certainly, when I look at	
				Remnant Island...	
0x1a6e	0x98	Aulbath		It would be good if this	
				is not an ill omen...	
0x1af2	0x98	Aulbath		So she was called Kureha...	
				Though somehow, she has a	
				mysterious air about her...	
0x1b64	0x98	Aulbath		..................	
				..................	
0x1bab	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x1bdd	0x98	Aulbath		Huhu, don't worry about it.	
				It's not a big deal.	
0x1c2f	0x98	Aulbath		She is your friend, is she?	
				You should make her feel welcome.	
0x1cc8	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, however, as for	
				that stupid son of mine...	
0x1d19	0x98	Aulbath		Why in the world did he...	
				..................?	
0x1d69	0x98	ALTO		(As expected, Master	
				 realizes how unnatural	
				 she is.)	
0x1dbd	0x98	ALTO		(I've got to find Cygna soon!)	
0x1e23	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, however, as for	mp_0002 0x1cc8
				that stupid son of mine...	
0x1e74	0x98	Aulbath		Why in the world did he...	mp_0002 0x1d19
				..................?	
0x1efa	0x98	Aulbath		I can't believe that Hell Fever	
				was repelled...	
				As you'd expect, I was surprised.	
0x1f6c	0x98	Aulbath		The rumor is, you supplied that	
				phantom Yupina Grass...	
0x1fc5	0x6B	Aulbath		Ellipsis	
0x1ffa	0x98	ALTO		U-Umm...	
				(As you'd expect, I wonder	
				 if I'm suspected...)	
0x2051	0x98	Aulbath		Huhu, well fine.	
				For now, I will congratulate	
				you on her recovery.	
0x20b4	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta.	
				That is exactly why	
				you are my son.	
0x210b	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...Thank you very much.	
0x2181	0x98	Aulbath		The rumor is, you supplied that	mp_0002 0x1f6c
				phantom Yupina Grass...	
0x21da	0x98	Aulbath		...Huhu, I will not inquire too deeply.	
				At the very least, Eartha was saved.	
0x2248	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta.	
				As you would expect,	
				you are my son.	
0x22c8	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x2248
				As you would expect,	
				you are my son.	
0x2320	0x98	Aulbath		Now, you should reflect	
				on your sister's recovery.	
0x23aa	0x98	Aulbath		It seems Eartha collapsed	
				due to sudden illness.	
0x23fc	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, though I thought	
				her complexion was good	
				lately...	
0x2454	0x98	Aulbath		That girl's heart is strong	
				and mends your weaknesses.	
0x24ac	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, especially now,	
				you should support her.	
0x24fd	0x98	ALTO		Yes!	mp_0001 0xfd91
0x2549	0x98	Aulbath		That girl's heart is strong	mp_0002 0x2454
				and mends your weaknesses.	
0x25a1	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, especially now,	mp_0002 0x24ac
				you should support her.	
0x2628	0x98	Aulbath		An uproar over Cygna leaving	
				home has just started.	
				I hope it is not serious.	
0x2696	0x98	Aulbath		Rather, since he was a child,	
				he has been doing this sort of thing,	
				though it has been awhile since the last time.	
0x2729	0x98	Aulbath		...However, it has been five years since then...	
				Time passes quickly, it seems...	
0x27c4	0x98	Aulbath		...It has been five years since then, huh...	
				Time passes quickly, it seems...	
0x2883	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, though you returned from the	
				ruins...	
				I wonder if anything happened there.	
0x28f6	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yes.	
				Neither me nor Cygna	
				got a single wound.	
0x2943	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm...then that is good.	
0x297e	0x98	ALTO		(..It seems I kept Noi a secret,	
				 and there's no way I can talk about	
				 the incident at the ruins or Terra.)	
0x2a09	0x98	Aulbath		For a moment, I sensed an	
				unusual presence in those ruins...	
				Somehow, it must have been my imagination.	
0x2a91	0x98	Aulbath		...I too have grown old.	
0x2acc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2afe	0x98	ALTO		(As expected from Master...	
				 If I'm not real careful, everything	
				 will be exposed immediately.)	
0x2bb5	0x98	Aulbath		For a moment, I sensed an	mp_0002 0x2a09
				unusual presence in those ruins...	
				Somehow, it must have been my imagination.	
0x2c3d	0x98	Aulbath		...I too have grown old.	
				I must train you more.	
0x2cb6	0x98	Aulbath		Anyhow, if anything happens,	
				please speak with me immediately.	
0x2d16	0x98	Aulbath		I will train you anytime.	
0x2dc0	0x98	Aulbath		Now, now, if Cygna were here,	
				it would be a little better training.	
0x2e25	0x98	Aulbath		Although he is in the town's vigilante	
				corps, his spirit has not much experience.	
0x2e98	0x98	Aulbath		Before long, I'll need	
				to personally scold him.	
0x2f05	0x98	Aulbath		Life is discipline itself...	
				Never neglect your training.	
0x2f60	0x98	Aulbath		Though rest is necessary,	
				people learn laziness and	
				go with the flow.	
0x2fc6	0x98	Aulbath		...I'll need to teach Cygna	
				that once again.	
0x303c	0x98	Aulbath		Life is discipline itself...	mp_0002 0x2f05
				Never neglect your training.	
0x3097	0x98	Aulbath		...I'll need to teach Cygna	mp_0002 0x2fc6
				that once again.	
0x3109	0x98	Aulbath		Use that sword freely, and	
				show me you can destroy	
				those scarecrows.	
0x316e	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, if it is you,	
				you will recover your	
				intuition immediately.	
0x322e	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, it seems you	
				have equipped a sword.	
0x3278	0x98	Aulbath		Then, if your heart is ready,	
				you should call on me again.	
0x3300	0x07	System	#4C	Please talk to Orvus using □.	
0x3335	0x98	Aulbath		Good grief. Though I asked	
				Cygna to come, he skipped	
				out on training all of a sudden.	
0x33ab	0x98	Aulbath		Well, fine.	
				This time, I will watch	
				you closely, Nayuta.	
0x3440	0x07	System	#4C	Equip weapons and armor by selecting	
				[Equip] from the camp menu.	
0x348e	0x07	System	#4C	Equip Nayuta with a sword,

0x34ee	0x98	Aulbath		That Cygna, I expected he'd run.	
0x3531	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, though it's been four months,	
				It seems you haven't grown...	
0x3593	0x98	Aulbath		...Nayuta, once you are ready,	
				call on me once again.

0x36da	0x98	Pyxia		Falling snow on the island of

				amazing inspiration has fallen!	
0x3756	0x98	Pyxia		I've got to sketch this at once!	
0x37bf	0x98	Pyxia		Falling snow on the island of

				sketch this at once...	
0x3832	0x98	Pyxia		...Eek, my drawing	
				paper got wet!	
0x38a9	0x98	Pyxia		Heading for the contest,	
				I can't decide what to draw.	
0x38fe	0x98	Pyxia		...That old man over	
				there has atmosphere.	
0x3948	0x98	Pyxia		"Master Fencer-Waiting for His	
				 Old Enemy."	
0x3993	0x98	Pyxia		...If I were to put a title on it,

0x3bbc	0x98	Horolo		As you'd expect, when it falls here,	
				it has a strange feeling.	
0x3c1b	0x98	Horolo		Pyxia saved a	
				painting of it.	
0x3c81	0x98	Horolo		Though the snow is pretty,	
				when it falls on this island,	
				it has a strange feeling.	
0x3cf3	0x98	Horolo		...If it accumulates, I'll make	
				a snow sculpture.	
0x3d7b	0x98	Horolo		I too think that man would	
				make a good model for	
				a statue, maybe.	
0x3ddc	0x98	Horolo		Huhu, the hair part would	
				be pretty difficult though.	
0x3e32	0x98	ALTO		(A statue of Master huh...	
				 It seems just placing it would	
				 be protection against monsters.)	
0x3ed4	0x98	Horolo		I too think that man would	mp_0002 0x3d7b

0x3f35	0x98	Horolo		If I asked him, I wonder if I could

0x4552	0x98	ALTO		I has been useful in my training.	
0x4593	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, is that so...

0x4fcf	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	
				you will gain various benefits	
				by accumulating CHAIN.	
0x5043	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	
				If you gain a benefit, it will be very	
				advantageous for you to continue fighting.	
0x50da	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be	
				interrupted after a fixed time.	
				It will also be interrupted if you take damage.	
0x5161	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively,	
				you need to cooperate with your allies,	
				and figure how not to interrupt your attacks.	
0x5207	0x98	Aulbath		There are stronger benefits	
				of CHAIN.	
0x524e	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or higher, earned experience will increase,	
				If CHAIN is 100 or higher, all sword attacks will be criticals.	
0x52ea	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	
				you will gain a benefit that steadily restores your stamina.	
0x5370	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate that much,	
				these benefit should be your ally	
				in tough battles.	
0x53f4	0x98	Aulbath		Bear in mind that when you are aiming at something,	
				aim at it with a positive attitude.	
0x5483	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash "Spinning Cut,"	
				you can hit even 	
				flying enemies.	
0x54e4	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch	
				small enemies into the sky.	
				If you master it, it will improve your battles.	
0x5564	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible to launch	
				large-build enemies. You should	
				bear that in mind.	
0x55fb	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique, "Vacuum Blade," that is	
				unleashed when CHAIN is 20 or higher, it has even more power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x56d6	0x98	Aulbath		"Down Thrust" is an attack that grows in strength	
				with the force of the drop.	
0x5745	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is that,	
				of all the sword techniques, it	
				boasts the highest attack power.	
0x57ca	0x98	Aulbath		Though it leaves a large gap,	
				there are many chances to use it.	
				Please try using it in your own way.	
0x586f	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Meteor Attack" that is unleashed	
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x594e	0x98	Aulbath		"Kamaitachi" is unleashing an	
				intense stroke of your sword	
				with a quick step.	
0x59bc	0x98	Aulbath		This technique with strong sword power	
				can damage enemies against which sword	
				attacks are ineffective.	
0x5a43	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, that power extends over a wide range.	
				The possibility of long-range attacks	
				is a feature of this technique.	
0x5afd	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Whirlwind" that is unleashed	
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x5bd8	0x98	Aulbath		"Swallow Return" is cutting	
				down all surrounding enemies	
				in an instant.	
0x5c40	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling surrounding enemies	
				towards you. In melee, it exhibits a terrible power.	
0x5ccc	0x98	Aulbath		Though among the sword techniques it is the	
				most difficult, if you master it, it will be a strong power.	
				Do not tire of this, and endeavor to train.	
0x5da1	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Fallen Lotus" that is unleashed	
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x5e7f	0x98	Aulbath		Among swords there exist	
				"One-Handed Swords" and	
				"Two-Handed Sword."	
0x5ee4	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords are maneuverable	
				and can unleash quick, successive attacks.	
				Generally, you can say they are easy to handle.	
0x5f82	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have high attack power,	
				and easily bringing down enemies is their characteristic.	
				However, they leave a large gap and are hard to handle.	
0x6051	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	
				I cannot say which is superior.	
				You should choose a sword which is easy for you to use.	
0x610c	0x98	Aulbath		Among monsters there are those

0xe951	0x98	Aulbath		You two, you've come at a good time.

0xf286	0x98	ALTO	#6A	This is?	
0xf2b1	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0xf2d7	0x98	NOI	#6A	A small box?	
0xf305	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xf332	0x98	Aulbath		It has been six years...	
				This was nearby when I	
				found young Cygna.	
0xf395	0x98	Aulbath		At that time, I took interest	
				in it and stowed it away,	
				but...	
0xf3f4	0x98	Aulbath		Recently, I found it while	
				sorting Cygna's belongings.	
0xf44c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	This is...	
0xf479	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm...It looks like this	
				box doesn't have a keyhole.	
0xf508	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0xf52d	0x98	ALTO		Though it has a lid, it's not	
				giving an inch...	
				How can we open this?	
0xf590	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_THINK	
0xf5ba	0x98	Aulbath		Though I have tried various	
				things, I have no idea.	
0xf60f	0x98	Aulbath		It seems made of a strange	
				metal, and I could not even	
				scratch it once.	
0xf6ad	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT2	
0xf6d7	0x98	Aulbath		Thinking you could find a way	
				to open it, I called you here.	
0xf75e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see...	
				So that's the situation.	
0xf7a1	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm, you might say	
				we don't have even one clue...	
0xf7f4	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xf826	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Huh, when I look at the box closely...	
				Doesn't it seem like some kind of letters	
				are carved in it?	
0xf8a9	0x98	NOI	#6A	These are...	
				The ancient letters of the Mythos?	
0xf911	0x98	Aulbath		It is likely they contain a	
				hint for opening the box.	
0xf968	0x98	Aulbath		Noi, you can read those	
				letters, can you not?	
0xf9b7	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0xf9db	0x98	NOI	#6A	I-I'll try.	
				...Ehem, umm...	
0xfa30	0x98	NOI	#6A	"This box is sealed	mp_0002 0x6499

0xfa77	0x98	NOI	#6A	"If you would release them,	
				 offer up this box	
				 as the seasons change"...	
0xfb18	0x98	NOI	#6A	It looks like that's what's written.	
0xfbb3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0xfbe3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0xfc17	0x98	ALTO		Four locks...	
				And we have to offer it up	
				as the seasons change?	
0xfc74	0x98	ALTO		Disregarding the first half,	
				I don't get what it means by offer	
				it up as the seasons change."	
0xfcef	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xfd18	0x98	NOI	#6A	It probably means to shower it	
				in Power of Stars that is attuned	
				to each season.	
0xfd88	0x98	NOI	#6A	We can use the Astrolabe	
				to change the season...	
0xfddb	0x98	NOI	#6A	This was made	
				using the same technology.	
0xfe24	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0xfe5f	0x98	ALTO		Hmm...Using something like that	
				expressly for that device,	
				there must be something important inside.	
0xfee1	0x98	ALTO		...But, what should we do.	
				We can't manipulate the Power of Stars.	
0xff42	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xff6b	0x98	NOI	#6A	You're right, then...	
0xffa2	0x98	NOI	#6A	Then we should probably	
				search for the "Power Place"	
				of the Power of Stars.	
0x1000d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x10037	0x98	ALTO		The "Power Place" of the	
				Power of Stars?	
0x1007e	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_THINK	
0x100a8	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm...It seems like something	
				that could be called a power gathering	
				place.	
0x1012c	0x98	NOI	#6A	The one I took over for, the	
				"Past Noi" had some relevant	
				knowledge.	
0x10190	0x98	NOI	#6A	In Terra on the four continents,	
				there seem to be places where the Power of Stars	
				flows more strongly than the surroundings...	
0x10230	0x98	NOI	#6A	If we use places like that,	
				we can fake out the "mechanism	
				that uses the seasons."	
0x102c3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x102ed	0x98	ALTO		I see, if we take the box	
				to those places...	
0x10338	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x10360	0x98	ALTO		But, as for places like that,	
				where are they, I wonder?	
0x103be	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x103f0	0x98	ALTO		(Speaking of that...during my adventures	
				 a year ago, I saw devices that use the seasons	
				 many times...)	
0x10476	0x98	ALTO		(Could it be the locations on	
				 each continent where the	
				 "wardens were imprisoned?")	
0x104f0	0x98	ALTO		(And, "the way the seasons	
				 change," huh?)	
0x10539	0x98	ALTO		(The order the seasons change...

				 think about that.)	
0x105bc	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT3	
0x105e6	0x98	Aulbath		Huhu, it seems you have

0x10632	0x98	Aulbath		If you open the box,

0x106ba	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x106df	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yes, I wonder what is

0x10c6a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yes, somehow we managed to

0x10ccd	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Allow me to hand it over to you.	
0x10d35	0x06	ALTO		ANI_HANDOVER

0x11226	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1

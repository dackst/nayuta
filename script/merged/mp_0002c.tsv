0x34c	0x98	Aulbath		Strong monsters have appeared

0x3b3	0x98	Aulbath		Although my injuries are still getting

0x433	0x98	Aulbath		Please take care of that young

0x4c1	0x98	Aulbath		Please take care of the young lady	mp_0002c 0x433

0x527	0x98	Aulbath		I know you can do it.	
				I believe in you, my	
				student.	
0x5db	0x98	Aulbath		If you are prepared, I am certain	
				you will be able to stand up to Zext.	
0x649	0x98	Aulbath		You should save the young lady	
				Kureha, no matter what it takes.	
0x6b1	0x98	Aulbath		As for that idiot... Please	
				serve him an extra-large	
				scolding in my stead.	
0x755	0x98	Aulbath		If you are prepared, I am certain	mp_0002c 0x5db

				of Zext.	
0x7c3	0x98	Aulbath		And, as for that idiot...	mp_0002c 0x6b1
				As a substitute for me, please bring

0x867	0x98	Pyxia		I've started painting pictures	
				of the people of this island.	
0x8c2	0x98	Pyxia		With the current situation	
				being as it is, the contest
				is probably canceled though...	
0x91c	0x98	Pyxia		In any kind of bad situation, the image	
				of everyone standing up and working together	
				should be encouraging to lots of people.	
0x9c1	0x98	Pyxia		In any kind of bad situation,	mp_0002c 0x91c

0xa3e	0x98	Pyxia		I'll to do my best to	
				finish this drawing!	
talk_Horolo
0xabb	0x98	Horolo		There are stones that seem usable	
				for statues all over the place...	
0xb1c	0x98	Horolo		Maybe I should make	
				a statue of you guys.	
0xb6c	0x98	Horolo		You all seem to be doing whatever	
				you can in this situation...	
				I get that, you know~?	
0xc11	0x98	Horolo		I wonder if I should make	mp_0002c 0xb1c
				a statue of you guys.	
0xc61	0x98	Horolo		You guys seem to be doing whatever	mp_0002c 0xb6c

				I get that feeling, you know?

0x1098	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, it's Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x44ae
				That thing you have is...	
				A training book, is it not?	
0x10ff	0x98	ALTO		Yes, I received it	mp_0002 0x4515
				from Cygna.	
0x113c	0x98	ALTO		I has been useful in my training.	mp_0002 0x4552
0x117d	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, is that so...	mp_0002 0x4593
0x11e6	0x98	Aulbath		It seems you've collected the	mp_0002 0x45fc
				stamps little by little.	
0x123e	0x98	Aulbath		...Yes, if you collect a few more	mp_0002 0x4654
				stamps, you should be able to	
				learn a new sword skill.	
0x12b7	0x98	ALTO		Wha...a skill?	mp_0002 0x46cd
0x12e5	0x98	ALTO		Oh, Cygna used them often	mp_0002 0x46fb
				when extermination monsters...	
0x133c	0x98	Aulbath		Mm, when facing formidable foes,	mp_0002 0x4752
				they will be extremely useful.	
0x139d	0x98	Aulbath		In time, I plan to teach you the	mp_0002 0x47b3
				same skills as Cygna.	
0x13f5	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, you are very diligent.	mp_0002 0x480b

0x145c	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...somehow, I'm happy.	mp_0002 0x4872

0x1bb9	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	mp_0002 0x4fcf
				you will gain various benefits	
				by accumulating CHAIN.	
0x1c2d	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	mp_0002 0x5043
				If you gain a benefit, it will be very	
				advantageous for you to continue fighting.	
0x1cc4	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be	mp_0002 0x50da
				interrupted after a fixed time.	
				It will also be interrupted if you take damage.	
0x1d4b	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively,	mp_0002 0x5161
				you need to cooperate with your allies,	
				and figure how not to interrupt your attacks.	
0x1df1	0x98	Aulbath		There are stronger benefits	mp_0002 0x5207
				of CHAIN.	
0x1e38	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or higher, earned experience will increase,	mp_0002 0x524e
				If CHAIN is 100 or higher, all sword attacks will be criticals.	
0x1ed4	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	mp_0002 0x52ea
				you will gain a benefit that steadily restores your stamina.	
0x1f5a	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate that much,	mp_0002 0x5370
				these benefit should be your ally	
				in tough battles.	
0x1fde	0x98	Aulbath		Bear in mind that when you are aiming at something,	mp_0002 0x53f4
				aim at it with a positive attitude.	
0x206d	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash "Spinning Cut,"	mp_0002 0x5483
				you can hit even 	
				flying enemies.	
0x20ce	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch	mp_0002 0x54e4
				small enemies into the sky.	
				If you master it, it will improve your battles.	
0x214e	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible to launch	mp_0002 0x5564
				large-build enemies. You should	
				bear that in mind.	
0x21e5	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique, "Vacuum Blade," that is	mp_0002 0x55fb
				unleashed when CHAIN is 20 or higher, it has even more power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x22c0	0x98	Aulbath		"Down Thrust" is an attack that grows in strength	mp_0002 0x56d6
				with the force of the drop.	
0x232f	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is that,	mp_0002 0x5745
				of all the sword techniques, it	
				boasts the highest attack power.	
0x23b4	0x98	Aulbath		Though it leaves a large gap,	mp_0002 0x57ca
				there are many chances to use it.	
				Please try using it in your own way.	
0x2459	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Meteor Attack" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x586f
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x2538	0x98	Aulbath		"Kamaitachi" is unleashing an	mp_0002 0x594e
				intense stroke of your sword	
				with a quick step.	
0x25a6	0x98	Aulbath		This technique with strong sword power	mp_0002 0x59bc
				can damage enemies against which sword	
				attacks are ineffective.	
0x262d	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, that power extends over a wide range.	mp_0002 0x5a43
				The possibility of long-range attacks	
				is a feature of this technique.	
0x26e7	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Whirlwind" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x5afd
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x27c2	0x98	Aulbath		"Swallow Return" is cutting	mp_0002 0x5bd8
				down all surrounding enemies	
				in an instant.	
0x282a	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling surrounding enemies	mp_0002 0x5c40
				towards you. In melee, it exhibits a terrible power.	
0x28b6	0x98	Aulbath		Though among the sword techniques it is the	mp_0002 0x5ccc
				most difficult, if you master it, it will be a strong power.	
				Do not tire of this, and endeavor to train.	
0x298b	0x98	Aulbath		As for the secret technique "Fallen Lotus" that is unleashed	mp_0002 0x5da1
				when CHAIN is 20 or more, it has even more attack power.	
				You should confirm that for yourself in battle.	
0x2a69	0x98	Aulbath		Among swords there exist	mp_0002 0x5e7f
				"One-Handed Swords" and	
				"Two-Handed Sword."	
0x2ace	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords are maneuverable	mp_0002 0x5ee4
				and can unleash quick, successive attacks.	
				Generally, you can say they are easy to handle.	
0x2b6c	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have high attack power,	mp_0002 0x5f82
				and easily bringing down enemies is their characteristic.	
				However, they leave a large gap and are hard to handle.	
0x2c3b	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	mp_0002 0x6051
				I cannot say which is superior.	
				You should choose a sword which is easy for you to use.	
0x2cf6	0x98	Aulbath		Among monsters there are those	mp_0002 0x610c
				which can cause various abnormal	
				statuses.	
0x2d60	0x98	Aulbath		There is "poison" which saps your stamina,	mp_0002 0x6176
				and "paralysis" which substantially lowers	
				your movement ability...	
0x2def	0x98	Aulbath		"Freeze" which stops your movements,	mp_0002 0x6205
				and "confuse" which derails your actions.	
0x2e5f	0x98	Aulbath		Though with time, all are restored,	mp_0002 0x6275
				there exists equipment which offers	
				resistance and recovery items.	
0x2ee6	0x98	Aulbath		If you are heading to a dangerous	mp_0002 0x62fc
				battle, you should get your	
				preparations in order.

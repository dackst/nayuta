0x574	0x40	UNDEF		Afterwards, Noi and Nayuta collected	
				the Master Gear sitting at the altar.	
0x5e0	0x40	UNDEF		Then, to chase after the distant Cygna, they decided	
				to return to the Garden for the time being.	
0x742	0x40	NOI		Anyway...	
				Good thing we were able to recover	
				the Master Gear of Earth.	
0x7b4	0x40	ALTO	#0W	..................	mp_0002 0x1b64
0x884	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Hey, Nayuta...	
0x8bf	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x906	0x98	ALTO		Sorry... Cygna has never done	
				anything like that before.	
0x964	0x98	NOI	#6A	You... You've known	
				Cygna for a long time,	
				haven't you?	
0x9c2	0x98	NOI	#6A	Have you known him	
				since you were kids?	
0xa12	0x98	ALTO		Heh... It hasn't	
				been THAT long.	
0xa5d	0x98	ALTO		Cygna came to the island five years ago...	
0xaaf	0x98	ALTO		Even though Cygna lost his memory,	
				my sword-fighting instructor	
				took care of him.	
0xb1d	0x98	NOI	#6A	Really!?	
0xb4f	0x98	ALTO		By chance, he happened to find	
				him washed up on the beach.	
0xba4	0x98	ALTO		...I had just lost both	
				my parents recently.	
0xc03	0x98	ALTO		And my sister had started	
				working in star shard	
				observation...	
0xc66	0x98	ALTO		Day after day, I would sit in front of	
				their grave, staring blankly at the sea.	
0xcdc	0x98	ALTO		At a time like that...	
				Cygna called out to me.	
0xdb7	0x3F	Name		Cygna	mp_0101 0x14e16
0xdc4	0x40	ALTO	#0W#266c	If you sit there all day like that,	
				nothing interesting will happen, y'know?	
0xe32	0x40	ALTO	#0W#266c	Actually, while walking around this	
				island, I came up with a good idea.	
0xea6	0x40	ALTO	#0W#266c	A "Handyman Shop"...	
				Ya wanna do it with me?	
0xfa2	0x98	ALTO		...Even though he lost his memory,	
				he was that positive...	
				I think it encouraged me somehow.	
0x1025	0x98	ALTO		Ever since then, we grew close,	
				and we've always been together.	
0x1086	0x98	NOI	#6A	I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x10bd	0x98	ALTO		Even so... I didn't	
				expect you to ask	
				about our past.	
0x111a	0x98	ALTO		Ehehe, maybe you're starting to	
				warm up to humans a little?	
0x1176	0x6B	NOI		Unknown	
0x119f	0x98	NOI	#6A	N-No way that would ever happen!	
0x11fc	0x98	NOI	#0W#6A#12S	...It's nothing, really...	
0x1247	0x98	ALTO		Hehe... Anyway, once we	
				return to the Garden,	
				let's search for Cygna.	
0x12c6	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna...	
				 What could've happened to you?)

0x1948	0x98	NOI		What should I do...?	
0x1997	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...I don't know the details.	
0x19d6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	But maybe there are circumstances	
				that explain this, too...	
0x1a5c	0x98	NOI		...Yeah... For now, we	
				should think about what	
				we should do next...

0x21a8	0x98	NOI		This feeling...	
0x21f6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What's wrong, Noi?	
0x2248	0x98	NOI		...If we explore Terra,	
				we should be cautious.	
0x229c	0x98	NOI		Oltapia, Rieseweld,	
				Heimmel, La Worg...	
0x22e9	0x98	NOI		I feel a strong power coming	
				from each of their temples.	
0x2348	0x98	NOI	#0W	Is this...? The idols are out of control!?#0W	
0x239e	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x23d0	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The idols...!?	
0x23ff	0x98	ALTO	#6A	B-But we should have defeated the	
				idols of the four continents...	
0x246b	0x98	NOI		It is possible that because of	
				abnormalities in the Astrolabe,	
				they revived.	
0x24d2	0x98	NOI		What's more, somehow,	
				they're stronger than	
				they were before.	
0x252f	0x98	NOI		It looks like the climate has turned	
				strange again, so we can't get close	
				to the temples...	
0x25bc	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x25ee	0x98	ALTO	#6A	No... Let's try it.	
0x2626	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It's possible the idols are stopping	
				the temples from functioning.	
				I can't leave things like this.	
0x26ac	0x98	ALTO	#6A	And, I have to become stronger	
				to repair the abnormalities in	
				the Astrolabe.	
0x2717	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The reason those idols exist is to	
				be the ideal oppeonents, right?	
0x278c	0x98	NOI		Nayuta... You're right.	
0x27c1	0x98	NOI		I'm not only doing this	
				for the Mitos...	
0x28ae	0x98	NOI		I'm ready. As your partner,	
				I will follow you anywhere.	
0x2915	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yeah, thanks.	
0x2945	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's prepare ourselves and try going	
				to each of the four temples.
				For Creha and Cygna!

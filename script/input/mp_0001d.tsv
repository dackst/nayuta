0x484	0x98	ALTO		I don't have time for any detours...	
				I've got to look for Kureha!	
quest_Pyxia					
0x548	0x98	Pyxia		...Michey? What is that?	
				I haven't seen him.	
0x594	0x98	Pyxia		At least, I don't think he's	
				gone to the ruined tower.	
talk_Pyxia					
0x616	0x98	Pyxia		Though I asked that pretty girl	
				to model for my picture...	
0x670	0x98	Pyxia		...She said she doesn't have	
				time for that sort of thing.	
0x6c9	0x98	Pyxia		I'm going to sock that man in	
				black with a spatula the	
				next time I see him!	
0x75b	0x98	Pyxia		That man in black...	
				I won't forgive him.	
0x7a4	0x98	Pyxia		If I find him,	
				I'll sock him with a spatula!	
talk_Horolo					
0x81e	0x98	Horolo		It looks like there are hardly	
				any buildings on the island	
				that are all right.	
0x88c	0x98	Horolo		It also looks like there are	
				plenty of injured people resisting...	
0x8ef	0x98	Horolo		I really get the feeling that	
				he came to the island just	
				to steal away that girl...	
0x98a	0x98	Horolo		Just why did that man in black	
				come to the island to steal	
				that girl?	
0x9ef	0x98	Horolo		Somehow, I wonder if there was	
				some special reason...?	
talk_Lyra					
0xa74	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xa9d	0x98	ALTO		Lyra...	
				If you're here now, you'll get hurt.	
0xae8	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, I know that, but...	
0xb21	0x98	Lyra		...Kureha...	
				Why was she taken away, I wonder...	
0xb70	0x98	Lyra		If she hated us that much,	
				then why...	
0xbb5	0x98	ALTO		I don't know, but...	
0xbe9	0x98	ALTO		Kureha thanked	
				everyone on the island...	
				She said she had fun here.	
0xc4a	0x98	ALTO		That's why I am sure, this kind of	
				Kureha wouldn't want anything	
				like this.	
0xcb3	0x98	ALTO		...That's reason enough for me.	
0xcf2	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0xd1b	0x98	Lyra		...Yeah, got it.	
				I believe in you, Nayuta.	
0xd64	0x98	Lyra		When you say it like that,	
				I wonder what kind of impossible	
				task you're trying to accomplish.	
0xddf	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...that might be true.	
0xe1a	0x98	Lyra		Unfortunately, it's like that, *sigh*...	
0xe62	0x98	Lyra		Well, fine.	
				It also seems	
				Cygna went to that world.	
0xeb3	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, please look after	
				those two. I'm sure you	
				can bring them back for us!	
0xf46	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta...	
				I'm sure you'll bring back	
				Cygna and Kureha for us!	
0xfa1	0x98	Lyra		I'll be waiting on this island.	
				For your return.

0x10bc	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x10ee	0x98	ALTO		Now that you mention it...	mp_0001 0x391b
				I bought a "doghouse"	
				at the general store, didn't I?	
0x115c	0x98	ALTO		If I have this, I can give	mp_0001 0x3989
				this one a place protected	
				from wind and rain, but...	
0x11ca	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis

0x129a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, is that so.	mp_0001 0x3ac7
0x12cc	0x98	ALTO		Alright...I'll consult with Eartha	mp_0001 0x3af9
				about it immediately.	
0x1349	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta returned home, and consulted	mp_0001 0x3b76
				with Eartha about the stray dog.	
0x13ad	0x40	UNDEF		Though Eartha was surprised at first, she heard	mp_0001 0x3bda
				the information and gladly OK'd the idea.	
0x1540	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x156a	0x98	ALTO		Huh, I haven't seen you before.	mp_0001 0x3d94
0x15a9	0x98	ALTO		I wonder if you wandered onto	mp_0001 0x3dd3
				the ferry and came ashore	
				onto this island.	
0x1610	0x6B	Dog		Unknown	
0x1641	0x98	Dog		Wafu, wafu...	mp_0001 0x3e6b
0x166d	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, you're cute.	mp_0001 0x3e97
0x16a0	0x98	ALTO		(...That's right, I wonder	mp_0001 0x3f89
				 if I can keep him at home?)	
0x16f6	0x98	ALTO		(If I had a proper doghouse	mp_0001 0x3fdf
				 it would be fine... I wonder if	
				 I could look for one at the general store.)	
0x17f7	0x98	Dog		Ruff, ruff.	mp_0001 0x38bf
0x1821	0x98	ALTO		(If I had a doghouse,	mp_0001c 0x3ddd

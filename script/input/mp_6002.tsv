0x109a	0x40	UNDEF		An ancient-looking script is written here.	mp_6000 0x240f
0x110d	0x98	ALTO		This tablet...	mp_6000 0x2482
				There's something
				written here.
0x1159	0x98	NOI		Hmm, it does look like some	mp_6000 0x24ce
				kind of ancient text, but...
0x11a5	0x98	NOI		We don't have time to	mp_6000 0x251a
				read it right now.
				Let's come back later!
0x1207	0x98	ALTO		Okay... I guess you're right.	mp_6000 0x257c
0x1239	0x98	ALTO		(I might want to take a note	mp_6000 0x25ae
				 of this location, just in case.)
0x12ba	0x40	UNDEF		An ancient-looking script is written here.	mp_6000 0x240f

0x164a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Looks like something	mp_6000 0x294b
				is written on this tablet.
0x169e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x16c6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Do you think it might say	mp_6000 0x29c7
				anything interesting...?
0x1712	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x173b	0x98	NOI	#6A	It looks like they're written	mp_6000 0x2a3c
				in ancient script. I'll read it.
0x178b	0x98	NOI	#6A	Let's see...	mp_0002 0x10ffb
0x17b9	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x17ea	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x1810	0x98	NOI	#6A	...It looks like only	mp_6000 0x2b11
				part of the message
				is written here.
0x186e	0x98	NOI	#6A	To read it properly,	mp_6000 0x2b6f
				I think we'll need the
				other parts as well.
0x18cb	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x18fb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1925	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then for now, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2c26
				what's on this tablet.
0x1980	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's search for the other tablets,	mp_6000 0x2c81
				write them all down, and bring it
				to Dr. Volans for inspection.
0x1a01	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x1a25	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah, sure!	mp_0101 0x956b
0x1abc	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hey, another tablet!	mp_6000 0x2dbd
0x1af4	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1b1e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	All right, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2e1f
				a copy of what it says.
0x1b6b	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta wrote down the contents of the tablet.	mp_6000 0x2e6c
0x1bbb	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558

0x1cef	0x06	NOI		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x1d18	0x98	NOI	#6A	Ah... If we combine all of what we've	mp_6000 0x3019
				found so far, it seems like they
				fit together into a single document!
0x1d9d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1dc7	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Looks like we've got all	mp_6000 0x30c8
				the information we need.
0x1e16	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's take it straight	mp_6000 0x3117
				to Dr. Volans.
0x1eae	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x1ed4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hmm... It still doesn't	mp_6000 0x31d5
				look complete.
0x1f34	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1f5e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Well, let's continue searching	mp_6000 0x325f
				for the other tablets, then.

				I thought this was

0x197d	0x98	NOI		I see... Looks like the lock	mp_1002b 0x27a4
				was made using areas filled
				with the Power of Stars.
0x1a05	0x98	NOI		But I think we're not	mp_1002b 0x2817

0x1a57	0x98	ALTO		If I remember correctly, didn't it say,	mp_1002b 0x2863
				"offer up this box in order of the seasons,

0x1ad7	0x98	ALTO		(Maybe I need to follow some	mp_1002b 0x290a

0x4c66	0x06	Algorl		ANI_NOD	
0x4c8d	0x98	Algorl		I see, so that masked man...

0x4d24	0x98	Algorl	#0W	...I thought as much.	
0x4d66	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x4d8f	0x98	NOI	#6A	Algol... What do

0x5074	0x98	Algorl		He had a strong sense of justice, and

0x5109	0x06	Algorl		ANI_DENY	
0x5131	0x98	Algorl		Even if he was the head of their race,

0x519a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x51c1	0x98	ALTO	#6A	If Selam isn't an imposter, then...	
				Maybe he's being manipulated...?	
0x5231	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Then again, I could

0x5719	0x98	Algorl		Nevertheless, forge on ahead, you two,

0x579e	0x98	Algorl		I will grant you, Noi,

talk_Dorado					
0xb7b	0x98	Dorado		I was just about to leave	
				for patrol with Ax and	
				the others, but...	
0xbde	0x98	Bootie		...Hey, don't ignore me.	
				Take me with you too!	
0xc2d	0x6B	Dorado		Sweatdrop	
0xc8f	0x98	Dorado		Ugh, you're so annoying!!	
				This is a job for adults!	
0xcdf	0x98	Dorado		Besides, didn't you just get scared	
				when I was attacked by that monster	
				the other day?	
0xd6c	0x98	Dorado		Lately, a lot of ferocious monsters	
				have been appearing. We've had to	
				increase our patrols.	
0xde1	0x98	Dorado		I've got to fulfill my duty	
				as the town guard!	
talk_Lupus					
0xe72	0x98	Lupus		That rubble just wouldn't budge.	
				I thought it'd be funny to ask	
				my mom to help, but...	
0xee1	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0xf14	0x98	Lupus		...I never thought she	
				could actually move it...	
0xf7c	0x98	Lupus		Not even Columba and Sculp together	
				could move that rubble...	
0xfcf	0x98	Lupus		There's a freaking secret weapon	
				hiding in town...	
0x1054	0x98	Lupus		Just in time, Doctor. My	
				grandpa wants to see you.	
0x10af	0x98	Lupus		As the village elder, he	
				wants to hear more about	
				your doctor's rounds.	
0x10fd	0x98	Hydol		I see... I wanted to ask	
				him some questions as well.	
0x1154	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	
				All right, let's be on our way.	
0x1211	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, we can handle	
				the island for now.	
0x1258	0x98	Lupus		Just don't push yourself too hard, okay?	
talk_Canis					
0x12bd	0x98	Canis		*huff*, *huff*, *huff*	
				I thought I'd try to clear	
				out this rubble, but...	
0x1317	0x98	Canis		It looks like these slender womanly	
				arms of mine can only do so much.	
0x1373	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x13a6	0x98	Lupus		(I-I can't believe it...	
				 She's really moving it	
				 all by herself...)	
0x142c	0x98	Canis		I may not be of much use, but	
				I'll do everything I can to help.	
0x1480	0x98	Canis		Nayuta and everyone else	
				are working so hard...	
				I can't get complacent!	
talk_Columha					
0x1503	0x98	Columha		I've been cleaning up the wreckage	
				with some of the stronger men in	
				the village...	
0x156a	0x98	Columha		...But this one won't budge at all.	
				It seems impossible to move with	
				human hands...	
0x15d0	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time, it seems	
				the only thing we can do is crush it	
				into smaller pieces with a hammer.	
0x1662	0x98	Columha		We've been working the last few days trying	
				to clean up the debris... But pushing this	
				one away is proving to be too difficult.	
0x16de	0x98	Columha		Though it'll take some time, it seems	mp_0000c 0x15d0
				the only thing we can do is crush it	
				into smaller pieces with a hammer.	
talk_Ursaminor					
0x17b9	0x98	Ursaminor		Even though the world has become	
				like this, I'm glad to be able to

				Father, I'll be even happier.	
talk_Ursaminor_and_Reticul					
0x188b	0x98	Ursaminor		Reticul, I'm glad you're safe...	
0x18d0	0x98	Ursaminor		I was really worried about you...	
0x1916	0x98	Reticul		Ursamina...	
				Yeah, I'm really sorry.	
0x195b	0x98	Reticul		I'll be here for a while helping	
				out with rebuilding the village,	
				so there's no need to worry.	
0x19cf	0x98	Ursaminor		...Will you make	
				up with Father?	
0x1a12	0x98	Reticul		Umm, well... You know, it'd be a little	
				awkward for us to meet each other...	
0x1a8a	0x98	Reticul		B-But maybe someday, okay?	
talk_Sculp					
0x1c12	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta, I've got	mp_0000 0x7935
				a question for you.	
0x1c63	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	mp_0000 0x7988
				What is it?	
0x1ca5	0x98	Sculp		I actually heard this	mp_0000 0x79cb
				from Antlia recently...	
0x1d00	0x98	Sculp		Apparently using fertile soil	mp_0000 0x7a23
				will greatly improve crop yield.	
0x1d70	0x98	Sculp		It's supposed to be better than manure,	mp_0000 0x7a7d
				and pretty popular on the continent.	
0x1dcb	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	mp_0000 0x7adf
				I can't find any good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x1e4c	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh?	mp_0000 0x7b57
				I don't think so.	
0x1ea7	0x98	ALTO		To begin with, Remnant Island soil	mp_0000 0x7bb0
				is probably rocky and full of salt...	
0x1f13	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	mp_0000 0x7c18
				If you say so, it must be true.	
0x1f67	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems like it's	mp_0000 0x7c75
				nothing but a fantasy for	
				us here, eh? Sorry, my bad.	
0x1fc6	0x98	Sculp		But if you ever do find some	mp_0000 0x7cd2
				good soil somewhere, it'd be	
				great if I could use it.	
0x203b	0x98	Sculp		Just keep an eye out for it.	mp_0000 0x7d44
0x207e	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x20ab	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile soil, huh?	mp_0000 0x7db3
				 If I find any, Maybe I should	
				 try bringing it to Sculp?)	
0x2253	0x98	Sculp		Hmm... It seems that we just might	
				be able to remove these stones now.	
0x22a6	0x98	Sculp		I can't believe there exists a human	
				who could move that by themselves.	
0x230d	0x98	Axe		Next is the one that fell near	
				your cow shed, I guess...	
0x2362	0x98	Axe		I'll meet you guys there as soon	
				as I'm finished with my patrol.	
0x240c	0x98	Sculp		Nayuta, don't worry about the	
				village. We'll protect the	
				place while you're gone.	
0x2492	0x98	Sculp		So you guys better make sure to	
				return safe and sound for us.	
0x2516	0x98	Sculp		A bunch of monsters we've never seen	
				before have been showing up lately.	
				We're telling everyone to be careful...	
0x2590	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, I'm glad Boote's safe.	
0x25d0	0x98	Sculp		However... maybe the kids shouldn't	
				be let outside for a while.	
0x265b	0x98	Sculp		We can't take any chances with	
				these monsters popping up.	
0x26b4	0x98	Sculp		Though Orvus is out on patrol, the	
				kids should stay inside regardless.	
0x2749	0x98	Sculp		Oh... What to do? Of all places,	
				this stupid rock had to fall	
				from the sky and land here...	
0x27ac	0x98	Sculp		Well at least Jessica's safe, and	
				the barn can always be fixed.	
0x280c	0x98	Sculp		More importantly, I've got	
				to think about the village.	
0x28ab	0x98	Sculp		That's right, all my crops have	
				powered through this weather.	
0x290b	0x98	Sculp		It might be because of the	
				soil you brought me, Nayuta.	
0x2964	0x98	Sculp		...Many thanks, Nayuta!	
0x29c2	0x98	Sculp		Tending to the fields, taking care of	
				Jessica, and now removing the boulder	
				from the village square.	
0x2a54	0x98	Sculp		Man, there's a lot to do, but we	
				gotta keep it together here.	
talk_Sculp_add					
0x2af2	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good soil!?	
0x2b46	0x98	Sculp		It's dark, has a soft texture and a fragrant,	mp_0000 0x97a3
				earthy scent... There's no mistaking it─	
				It's of excellent quality.	
0x2bd3	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I actually found it somewhere...	mp_0000 0x9830
0x2c1d	0x98	ALTO		Oh right, if you want it,	mp_0000 0x987a
				shall I give it to you?	
0x2cab	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	mp_0000 0x9907
0x2ce0	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	mp_0000 0x993c
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x2d5b	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha from the general	mp_0000 0x99b7
				store came by and said she wanted to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x2dd5	0x98	Sculp		I was so honored by her request,	mp_0000 0x9a31
				I thought I would respond in turn.	
0x2e6e	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, you've helped me out, Nayuta.	mp_0000 0x9aca
				Please use this well for me.	
0x2ecd	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	mp_0000 0x9b29
0x2f0a	0x98	ALTO		If you need anything else,	mp_0000 0x9b66
				don't hesitate to ask.	
0x2f62	0x98	Sculp		Haha, thank you. Good to know	mp_0000 0x9bbe
				I'm in good hands, Nayuta.

0x3150	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you have	
				some good soil again.	
0x31aa	0x98	Sculp		If you don't mind, can you please	mp_0000 0x9e06
				give it to me? I've got some things	
				I want to try on the field again.	
0x3230	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	mp_0000 0x9e8c
				If it's useful to you, Sculp.	
0x32a9	0x98	Sculp		Mmm, this is very fertile, too.	mp_0000 0x9f04
0x32e9	0x98	Sculp		All right... Time to go try it out.	mp_0000 0x9f44

0x3521	0x98	ALTO		There's, uh, various places.	mp_0000 0xa17c
0x355f	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I'm giving	mp_0000 0xa1ba

0x35d4	0x98	Sculp		Thanks as always.	mp_0000 0xa22e
				You're a great help.	
0x361d	0x98	Sculp		With soil this good,	mp_0000 0xa277
				I should be able produce	
				even more vegetables!	
0x3695	0x98	Sculp		Haha, for a farmer, there's	mp_0000 0xa2ef
				no better happiness than this.	
0x36fb	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these new	mp_0000 0xa355

				Nayuta, I'm glad you found this for me.

				looking at me like that...?	
				No way I'm staying home!	
0x3bfe	0x98	Bootie		It's times like these where a man has	
				to stand up for himself, isn't it?	
0x3c56	0x98	Bootie		So, the Remnant Island patrol begins!	
0x3c9c	0x98	Dorado		I said go home!	
0x3cfb	0x98	Bootie		...I can do something too, you know.	
0x3d3a	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, leave everyone in

				This is thanks for that.

0x40f0	0x98	Aquela		...It is passed down that	
				my clan made a grave error	
				in the distant past.	
0x4159	0x98	Aquela		It was said to have brought Calamity,	
				and sank the world into the sea...	
0x41c6	0x98	Aquela		So for generations, my clan has since watched	
				over this world from the shadows, passing down	
				this precautionary tale for future generations.	
0x4237	0x98	Aquela		Much lore has been lost over the years,	
				but I am here to do my duty to atone

0x4429	0x98	Aquela		I am sure my ancestors will be watching

0x44a3	0x98	Aquela		I will not pry into the details,

0x453f	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, I hope I did not surprise you	
				all of a sudden with this story.	
0x459c	0x98	Aquela		But the looks on your faces tell	
				me it was the right thing to do.	
0x45fe	0x98	Aquela		Though I am not sure of the specifics	
				of your mission... I feel it is	
				connected with our dearest wish.	
0x467f	0x98	Aquela		...Our wish to someday be forgiven	
				and redeemed of our mortal sin.	
0x4703	0x98	Aquela		Though I am not sure of the specifics

0x476b	0x98	Aquela		I am sure my ancestors are watching

0x480b	0x98	Aquela		I can see... Inside of your hearts

0x486e	0x98	Aquela		A flimsy thread of hope that

				necessary for moving forward.	
0x48f5	0x98	Aquela		Heh, what kind of future will it lead us to...?	
				We will have to watch it unfold for ourselves.	
0x4994	0x98	Aquela		I can see... Inside of your hearts

0x505b	0x98	Hydol		Lyra and Vel's exams are done.	mp_0000c 0x1154
				All right, let's be on our way.	
0x5124	0x98	Hydol		Though they were not particularly	
				injured, I examined Lyra and Vel	
				just to make sure.	
0x5197	0x98	Hydol		The only reason they survived after	
				encountering such a powerful monster	
				is thanks to you, Nayuta.	
0x5206	0x98	Hydol		Please continue to use your strength	
				to protect everyone, you two.	
0x528d	0x98	Hydol		There has been a rapid increase

0x54d0	0x98	ALTO		Sorry... But it's good to

0x5519	0x98	Reticul		Hmm, it seems like you're still	
				feeling a little unwell.	
0x5571	0x98	Reticul		Well, you'll survive. You just	
				need to rest a while longer.	
0x55f9	0x98	Reticul		Making up with Papa... Hmm, I've	
				been thinking about it, but...

0x5b16	0x98	Pyxia		We, too, must work hard to

0x5ba3	0x98	Pyxia		I can't believe that the beautiful blue

0x5c01	0x98	Pyxia		It reminds me of that

0x5c69	0x98	Pyxia		...I-It can't be.

0x33ca	0x98	Algorl		If the four wardens pool their

0x3424	0x98	Algorl		However, you are the only ones	
				who can save Lady Creha.	
				...We are counting on you.	
0x34d2	0x98	Algorl		There seems to be a chaotic situation unfolding...	
0x3519	0x98	Algorl		However, if Creha was indeed	
				kidnapped, it's only natural	
				that you should pursue them.	
0x3593	0x98	Algorl		We will do all we are able to support you.	
				...But now, you should hurry ahead.	
0x3622	0x98	Algorl		Going through such lengths, there's no	
				mistaking that Zext must be planning	
				to use Creha for something...	
0x3698	0x98	Algorl		Hurry onwards, you two.	
0x370b	0x98	Algorl		This magic I have given to Noi	
				is a fragment of my own power. 	
				...Use it wisely.	
0x377b	0x98	Algorl		In the coming days, you will

0x37e4	0x98	Algorl		For Terra and Lady Creha...	
				Please, take care of them.	
0x3866	0x98	Algorl		Hmm... As expected, I am currently in	
				no condition to restart this temple.	
0x38c2	0x98	Algorl		It seems that while I was imprisoned,	
				the situation grew worse by the second.	
0x3925	0x98	Algorl		...Zext. Just what

0x3e6e	0x98	Algorl		So you have safely found	
				Nemeas' nymph...	
0x3eb9	0x98	Algorl		Hmm, it seems to be heading back to	
				Nemeas' now that it has calmed down.	
0x3f24	0x98	Algorl		I am sure Nemeas will be pleased	
				to have another nymph return.	
				For that, I give my thanks.	
0x3f98	0x98	Algorl		The life signature of Nemeas' nymph	
				is in the southwest part of Heimmel,	
				near the Canyon of Biting Wind.	
0x4025	0x98	Algorl		You might wish to search 	
				with the season set to autumn.	
0x4078	0x98	Algorl		It seems the signature is considerably	
				distraught, so you should go quickly.	
0x41cb	0x98	Algorl		The fragments of my lost power should be	
				in the form of floating pale orbs of light	
				scattered across the Origin Continent.	
0x425a	0x98	Algorl		And thus, as the power is collected,

0x4bbe	0x98	Algorl		...Is that so? I thank you.	
0x4c1b	0x98	Algorl		As for the request I have for you...

0x4c81	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x4caa	0x98	NOI	#6A	Sealed power...?	
0x4cf3	0x98	Algorl		As you should already know, Noi...	
				I am the most combat-oriented among us wardens.	
0x4d7b	0x98	Algorl		I can easily match monsters,	
				or even one of the Mitos.	
0x4df5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x4e1d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Certainly, even when you were sealed,	
				I could feel tremendous power from you.	
0x4e8b	0x98	NOI	#6A	Algol is normally pretty tranquil,	
				but if he gets serious, he can	
				even blow up mountains.	
0x4f1a	0x98	Algorl		Mmm, but... since I was released	
				from the prison, I've recovered	
				only part of my power.	
0x4f8f	0x98	Algorl		...It seems that Lord Selam	
				placed a second seal on me.	
0x4fe8	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE	
0x5012	0x98	ALTO	#6A	A second seal!?	
0x5044	0x06	NOI		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x506d	0x98	NOI	#6A	You mean, he did something	
				in addition to the prison!?	
0x50c2	0x98	Algorl		Mmm... Apparently, my power was sealed	
				and divided into three separate pieces.	
0x512d	0x98	Algorl		And subsequently transferred	
				to another continent.	
0x51a9	0x98	Algorl		I may be being overly cautious...	
				But I cannot bring forth half of	
				my true power at the moment.	
0x5215	0x98	Algorl		With time, I could gradually	
				recover my power... But that	
				would take a long time indeed.	
0x529b	0x06	NOI		ANI_DEJECTED	
0x52c4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Oh, no...	mp_0100 0x1c977

0x536f	0x98	Algorl		I, too, deplore the current situation.	
0x53e7	0x98	Algorl		Now... I want your help	
				to recover my lost power	
				as soon as possible.	
0x544b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x5475	0x98	ALTO	#6A	We would be glad to help, but...	
0x54c4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What should we do, exactly?

0x56b8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What's this...?	
				It's kind of	
				dull and gray.	
0x5703	0x98	Algorl		That is a special jewel capable	
				of housing my power as a warden.	
0x5761	0x98	Algorl		With that, I want you to gather	
				the scattered fragments of my power.	
0x57fb	0x98	Algorl		As for where my power is sealed,	
				according to the nymphs, it seems to	
				be in La Worg, the Origin Continent.	
0x5890	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x58b9	0x98	NOI	#6A	La Worg...

0x5900	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD

0x597a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x59a4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Speaking of your power, Algol,

0x5a01	0x98	Algorl		My power will most likely	
				appear in the form of	
				floating pale orbs of light.	
0x5a60	0x98	Algorl		If you find one and bring it close,	
				the jewel will absorb it.	
0x5ad7	0x98	Algorl		And thus, as the power is collected,	mp_3099 0x425a
				light will gradually return to the jewel.	
0x5b49	0x98	Algorl		Bring the jewel back to me once	mp_3099 0x42cc

0x5bbb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS

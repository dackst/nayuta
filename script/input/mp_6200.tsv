0x11dd	0x98	ALTO		As we thought, it looks like	
				there ARE monsters here!	
0x122f	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x1257	0x98	Signa		We have to defeat them

0x12d3	0x98	Signa		All right, let's get

0x1601	0x07	System	#4C	When you continue to attack without taking damage,	
				[CHAIN] will accumulate in the lower-left of the screen.	
0x167b	0x07	System	#4C	When [CHAIN] reaches a certain amount,	
				extra bonuses such as increased attack	
				power will be gained.	
0x16f2	0x07	System	#4C	As long as your [CHAIN] continues,	
				the bonuses will remain in effect	
tutorial_collect
0x1adc	0x98	ALTO		Looks like rubble is blocking	
				the way. I guess we can jump	
				over it and keep going...	
0x1b64	0x98	Signa	#6A	Hmm... With that level of debris,	
				you should probably just destroy	
				it all with your sword.	
0x1bd4	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1bff	0x98	Signa	#6A	If you smash it, maybe something

0x208d	0x98	Signa		Oh man... The whole place

0x2274	0x98	Signa		Well, let's just keep going.	
				It looks like all we can do	
				to proceed is jump.	
0x2310	0x07	System	#4C	During exploration, if you	
				press × during a jump, you	
				perform a double-jump.	
0x236c	0x07	System	#4C	By using double-jumps,	
				you can reach places that

0x2b53	0x98	Signa		So, that device was to

0x2bb0	0x98	Signa		Haha, this is more

0x2bfe	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2c23	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, it's not often we get to

0x3e93	0x98	Signa	#6A	From the look of it, this

0x5043	0x98	Signa		"Keep your senses sharp at all

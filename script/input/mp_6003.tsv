0x1308	0x40	UNDEF		Something is written in ancient letters.	mp_6000 0x240f
0x137b	0x98	ALTO		This tablet...	mp_6000 0x2482
				Some sentence is	
				written on it.	
0x13c7	0x98	NOI		Hmm, they do look like	mp_6000 0x24ce
				ancient letters, but...	
0x1413	0x98	NOI		We don't have time to	mp_6000 0x251a
				read them right now.	
				Let's come check it later!	
0x1475	0x98	ALTO		Oh...You're right.	mp_6000 0x257c
0x14a7	0x98	ALTO		(For now, I should memorize	mp_6000 0x25ae
				 this location.)

0x17d0	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It looks like something	mp_6000 0x294b
				is written on this tablet.	
0x1824	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x184c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Maybe something important	mp_6000 0x29c7
				is written here?	
0x1898	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x18c1	0x98	NOI	#6A	They look like ancient	mp_6000 0x2a3c
				letters. I'll read them.	
0x1911	0x98	NOI	#6A	Let's see...	mp_0002 0x10ffb
0x193f	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x1970	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x1996	0x98	NOI	#6A	...It looks like only one	mp_6000 0x2b11
				part of the message	
				is written here.	
0x19f4	0x98	NOI	#6A	To read it properly,	mp_6000 0x2b6f
				I think we need the other	
				parts as well.	
0x1a51	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Is that so...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x1a81	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1aab	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then for now, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2c26
				the letters on this tablet.	
0x1b06	0x98	ALTO	#6A	We'll search for the other tablets,	mp_6000 0x2c81
				write them all down, and head	
				to Dr. Volans to inspect them.

0x1bab	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah, got it!	mp_0101 0x956b
0x1c42	0x98	NOI	#6A	There it is, a tablet!	mp_6000 0x2dbd
0x1c7a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1ca4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Alright, I'll record	mp_6000 0x2e1f
				the written letters.	
0x1cf1	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta wrote down the tablet's letters.	mp_6000 0x2e6c

0x1f23	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1f4d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It looks like we've gathered	mp_6000 0x30c8
				the information.	
0x1f9c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's take it to Dr. Volans	mp_6000 0x3117
				immediately.	
0x2034	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x205a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hmm...	mp_6000 0x31d5

0x20ba	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x20e4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, let's search	mp_6000 0x325f
				for the other tablets.

0x12eb	0x98	Asa	#6A	Oh my, you're stargazing.	
0x132c	0x98	Asa	#6A	Even if it is summer vacation,	
				it's not good for you to stay	
				up too late, okay?	
0x13a9	0x98	ALTO		...It's been a year...	
				Terra is starting to approach	
				the surface again.	
0x1426	0x98	ALTO		I thought it might look even bigger	
				now than it did last night.	
0x148a	0x06	Asa		ANI_NOD	
0x14ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	...Oh...	
0x14e0	0x06	Asa		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1509	0x98	Asa	#6A	I can't believe that it's	
				been a year already.	
0x157f	0x98	ALTO		Yeah... It really doesn't	
				feel like that long ago.	
0x15cb	0x98	ALTO		...I hope Cygna and Creha	
				are both doing well.	
0x1625	0x06	Asa		ANI_LAUGH	
0x164b	0x98	Asa	#6A	...Hehe, I'm sure they're fine.	
				They're both tough kids...	
0x16ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	I'm sure Noi is	
				watching over them.	
0x1712	0x98	ALTO	#0W	...Yeah, you're right.	
0x1753	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x1785	0x06	Asa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x17ae	0x98	Asa	#6A	Hehe, don't get yourself	
				too worked up about it.	
0x17f4	0x98	Asa	#6A	You don't want it to get in the	
				way of work tomorrow, do you?	
0x1879	0x98	ALTO		...Yeah, I know.	
				I'll go to bed soon.

0x1a17	0x98	ALTO		(...I don't know what I hope to
				 achieve by observing Terra.)		
0x1a6e	0x98	ALTO		(The transfer gate doesn't work anymore...	
				 There's no way I could go see them.)	
0x1acd	0x98	ALTO		(But obviously, I'm feeling	
				 kind of empty inside...)

0x1b99	0x98	ALTO		...Phew.	
0x1bc1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x1c05	0x98	ALTO		Cygna and the others	
				would laugh at me over	
				something like this.	
0x1c64	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x1c89	0x98	ALTO		It's summer vacation.	
				Gotta make the most of it!

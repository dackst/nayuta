0x1092	0x98	ALTO		(Looks like there's some high

0x114d	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x11ae	0x98	NOI		Nayuta, what's wrong?	
0x121a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Noi, is it okay if I try planting	
				this sapling here?	
0x1270	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x1294	0x98	NOI		Hmm, it should be fine,	
				I think, but...	
0x12eb	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1314	0x98	NOI		Just what are you planning?	
0x134e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_LAUGH	
0x1375	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hehe, you'll find out soon enough.	
0x1491	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SIT6	
0x1532	0x40	UNDEF		Planted the 100-Year Peach Sapling.

0x239e	0x98	Signa		Hmmm... We sure got here

0x2429	0x98	Signa		Hey, are you all right, Nayuta?	
0x24a3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_TIRED_WAIT	
0x24cf	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ah, I'm okay, just a little winded	
				by the teleporter device...	
0x2533	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I guess I'm just not used to	
				the sensation of my body being	
				hurled around at high speeds.	
0x25e7	0x98	NOI	#6A	Jeez, humans are so feeble...	
0x265d	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Hey, but Cygna seems	
				to be doing fine.	
0x26e5	0x98	Signa		Oh, yeah.	
0x270f	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2737	0x98	Signa		It might be because I train	
				daily for the city guard.	
0x2798	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ahaha, Cygna...	
				I gotta get used	
				to this soon, too.	
0x280f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0x2840	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...Anyway, so this is the

0x28da	0x06	ALTO		ANI_LOOK_AROUND	
0x2907	0x98	ALTO		The cherry trees are in full bloom.	
				It's a very beautiful place.	
0x2979	0x98	ALTO		And there's plants I've never seen	
				before growing everywhere...	
0x29e9	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2a11	0x98	ALTO		Maybe we should try viewing	
				the flowers with Eartha	
				and Lyra sometime...	
0x2aa6	0x98	NOI	#6A	It IS beautiful, but...	
				To me, it's also kind of eerie.

0x2b44	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2b6d	0x98	NOI	#6A	Normally, there should be hot
				sun and an ocean of verdant	
				foliage at this time of year.	
0x2c01	0x98	NOI	#6A	But since the Master Gear	
				was stolen, the climate has	
				been all screwed up.	
0x2c7d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2ca7	0x98	ALTO		Rapid and extreme weather changes	
				can wreak havoc on the ecosystem...	
				This isn't good.	
0x2d3c	0x98	NOI	#6A	Anyway, let's hurry up	
				and take back the	
				Master Gear...!	
0x2d95	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x2dbe	0x98	NOI		Let's go, you two!	
				Zext should definitely be

0x2e2e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x2e53	0x98	ALTO		Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x2e80	0x06	Signa		ANI_JOY	
0x2ea6	0x98	Signa		Looks like there are monsters here.	
				We should proceed with caution.	
0x2f5e	0x07	System	#4C	[NOI] has been added to the camp menu.	
					
0x2f9b	0x07	System	#4C	Noi has been added to your companions,	
				and you can now control her.	
0x2fec	0x07	System	#4C	Noi is a partner who can fight	
				using magic called 'arts.'	
				Use her well with Nayuta to continue.	
0x3315	0x07	System	#4C	Stage Clear status is now	
				displayed on the submenu.	
0x3357	0x07	System	#4C	Fast travel has also been	
				added to the submenu.

0x3c73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3c9d	0x98	ALTO		Right over there...	
				Looks like another	
				teleporter device!	
0x3d03	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x3d2c	0x98	NOI	#6A	We can use that to	
				proceed further inland.	
0x3df6	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x3e1c	0x98	NOI	#6A	Zext... Wonder where he's	
				planning on taking the	
				Master Gear...	
0x3f22	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x3f4a	0x98	Signa		Anyway, looks like he's not	
				here anymore. Let's just	
				keep moving forward.	
0x3fb5	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0x4029	0x6B	Signa		Surprise	
0x407b	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT	
0x40bf	0x98	Signa		Oh, right... Nayuta, I	
				was gonna give you this.	
0x4172	0x06	Signa		ANI_HANDOVER	
0x419d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_RECEIVE	
0x41ce	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558
0x4368	0x40	ALTO		Oh, that's...? Isn't this	
				that swordsmanship training	
				book you use all the time?	
0x43cf	0x40	ALTO		It's for recording significant	
				milestones in your training	
				with seals...	
0x4435	0x40	Signa		Yeah, I've used it since Master	
				gave it to me a while back.	
0x449c	0x40	Signa		I figured it's about time	
				I passed it down to you.	
0x455c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x458b	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that really okay!?	
				Giving this to me...	
0x45e6	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x460e	0x98	Signa		Oh, come on, why are you so surprised?	
				You are Master's student too, and you	
				already have a pretty good feel for swords.	
0x468b	0x98	Signa		I've pretty much finished the	
				training in it. You should use
				it so it won't go to waste.	
0x46fe	0x98	Signa		...Nayuta, when you've collected enough	
				training seals, you should show Master.	
				He'll probably give you some advice.	
0x47a7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x47cc	0x98	ALTO		Ha, okay then, thanks for	
				letting me have this.	
0x482e	0x98	Signa		Yeah, good luck.	
0x487f	0x98	Signa		Sorry, Noi, I got distracted.	
				Let's get going!	
0x48e4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e

0xd54	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	...That's... our world...	
0xda8	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	That's... what's... beyond
				the End of the World...?		
0xe25	0x06	NOI		ANI_DENY	
0xe52	0x98	NOI	#1W#6A	...No way...	
0xe8b	0x98	Creha	#0W	...At the time, the core of the	
				planet suffered terrible damage.	
0xef0	0x98	Creha	#0W	Even today, the planet's complete	
				destruction continues to advance.	
0xf44	0x98	Creha	#0W	The world established by the humans
				up until now is only temporary...	
0xfb6	0x98	Creha	#0W	At this rate, before long...
				The complete annihilation	
				of the planet will occur.	
0x11f1	0x98	Creha	#1W	Yet we have the power to restore the	
				world back to its beautiful former state.	
0x12d1	0x98	Creha	#1W	...Still...	
0x130a	0xBC	Creha		Ellipsis	
0x13b4	0x98	Creha	#1W	Still can you say what we're	
				trying to do is wrong!?	
0x1437	0x98	Creha	#1W#16S	Answer me, Nayuta!	
0x1479	0x98	NOI	#1W#6A	...Lady Creha...

0x17a5	0x98	ALTO	#2W#6A	You guys are wrong.	
0x1905	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x192f	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	People have lived out their lives on	
				the surface, carving out history.	
0x1994	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Even though there's little land left,	
				and their lifespans are short, people	
				can learn from the past...	
0x1a2b	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	The various archaeological	
				ruins and literature left	
				behind are proof of this.
0x1b81	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x1ba6	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	To us, our world is	
				definitely not temporary.	
0x1c02	0x98	NOI		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x1c7e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	When viewed from the god-like perspective
				of the Mitos, it's true this world is	
				tiny and inconsequential...	
0x1cfe	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Perhaps it's only natural you	
				would think of it as temporary.
0x1db0	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	But...	
0x1f61	0x98	ALTO	#0W#100x#270y	Even though it wasn't for very long,	
				you spent some time at my house, Creha.	
0x1ff6	0x98	ALTO	#0W#100x#270y	The past five years, Cygna has	
				worked at the Handyman Shop	
				with me on Remnant Island.	
0x208d	0x98	ALTO	#1W#100x#270y	You two should understand	
				already, shouldn't you?	
0x210f	0x98	ALTO	#3W#100x#270y	That this world is	
				truly precious.	
0x2218	0x98	Creha	#1W	......!	
0x235d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x2395	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	Humans and Mitos	
				can live together!	
0x23f9	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	There's gotta be something else that	
				can be done besides Recreating it!	
0x2475	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Don't give up until the end,	
				and we'll find it together!

0x3b2d	0x06	Creha3		ANI_NOD	
0x3b74	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Yeah... Looks like the planetary

0x3bd8	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Your world should	
				be okay now.	
0x3c27	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT6	
0x3c95	0x98	Signa	#0W	Well, I guess that takes care of that.	
0x3d3f	0x98	Signa	#0W	Because of all this, Terra has

0x3d9d	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Huh...?	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x3eab	0x98	ALTO	#0W#440x#230y	It's so... far...	
0x3fc4	0x06	Creha3		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x3ff8	0x98	Creha3	#0W	The recoil earlier	
				knocked it out of orbit.	
0x4050	0x98	Creha3	#0W	Terra's systems were used	
				for controlling that too...	
0x40b4	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT5	
0x40f3	0x98	Signa	#0W	It'll be some time before it

0x447b	0x98	Creha3	#2W	We can't leave Noi behind.

0x452b	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x4564	0x98	Signa	#1W	We're going to try to fix the

0x45ce	0x98	Signa	#1W	I don't know how long

0xb61	0x98	NOI		Though it looks pretty old,

0x5038	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT3	
0x5062	0x98	Aulbath	#0W#6A	Several years ago, shortly after I had

0x50d6	0x98	Aulbath	#0W#6A	On one occasion, while I was slaying monsters,	
				I stumbled upon this place by accident.	
0x51bf	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Here I came across a collapsed boy, looking	
				as if he had jumped out of the gate.	
0x522e	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Why was he here...?	
				Curious, I decided to peer inside the gate.	
0x535d	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	...What I saw inside was an	
				exceedingly beautiful world.	
0x53b8	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	It was like the world of Lost Heaven	
				that you can see through the star shards...	
				I had a hunch that it was that very place.	
0x5459	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	However, I... I sensed something terrible,	
				and turned back at once.	
0x54cb	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Soon after, this gate lost its light.	
				It did not open again.	
0x55fb	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	As for the boy, the village looked after him,	
				but he had lost all his memories.	
0x566f	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	...I took the responsibility of raising	
				him until he became an adult, or at	
				least until he recovered his memories.	
0x5701	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	Naming him Cygna Alhazen,	
				I taught him how to live from scratch.	
0x5781	0x40	Aulbath	#0W	From there, Cygna met Nayuta...

0x58a2	0x98	ALTO	#0W	So that's what happened...

0x5987	0x98	Aulbath	#6A	Now that he has regained his memories,

talk_Puppis					
0x4a9	0x98	Puppis		Everywhere on the Ciencia Sea,	
				there are stories about animals	
				somewhere starting to escape.	
0x525	0x98	Puppis		...It may be possible that the "Great Flood"	
				spoke of in legends is happening.	
0x594	0x98	Puppis		Us, without wings or gills,	
				even so, have to stick to	
				land and live.	
0x620	0x98	Puppis		According to legend, the	
				surface was once destroyed	
				by a "Great Flood."	
0x687	0x98	Puppis		Us, without wings or gills,	mp_0003c 0x594
				even so, have to stick to	
				land and live.	
0x721	0x98	Puppis		Even if you fell	
				from that broken moon,	
				you'd be fine.	
0x777	0x98	Puppis		Just how high is it?	
				I can't think that if a living	
				thing fell it would be fine.	
0x7e7	0x98	Puppis		Maybe some kind	
				of god is protecting	
				you.	
0x858	0x98	Puppis		Maybe some kind	mp_0003c 0x7e7
				of god is protecting	
				you.	
0x8a1	0x98	Puppis		A god that is	
				still our ally.	
0x915	0x98	Puppis		Hey boy.	
				...You seem down.	
0x950	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha...	
				D-Does it look that way?	
0x990	0x98	NOI		C-Captain.	
				It's been awhile.	
0x9ca	0x98	Puppis		Oh, the fairy's with you.	
				There's a strange toughness	
				about you two...	
0xa30	0x98	Puppis		Hmph, well whatever.	
				I'm not that kind of guy.	
0xa7f	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xab1	0x98	ALTO		"I'm not that kind of guy."	
				...What does that mean?	
0xb03	0x98	Puppis		Well the rumor is...War finally	
				broke out on the north continent.	
0xb65	0x98	Puppis		The uneasiness over this	
				abnormal weather will	
				magnify the chaos.	
0xbc6	0x98	Puppis		The flight of the nobles at Saint	
				Cerize is in chaos too...	
				This island is more peaceful.	
0xc3f	0x98	ALTO		I-Is that so...	
				Something like a war	
				at a time like this...	
0xc98	0x98	NOI		As expected, humans are foolish.	
				I cannot understand it...	
0xcf0	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0xd1a	0x6B	NOI		Ellipsis	
0xd4b	0x6B	Puppis		Sweatdrop	
0xd7f	0x98	Puppis		...You're making me depressed.	
0xdbf	0x98	Puppis		Forget this chat.	
				I'm not worried about the kids.	
0xe11	0x98	Puppis		The adults focused on our defense	
				are in a bit of a panic.	
0xe94	0x98	Puppis		The war is because of the neighboring	
				countries, the broken moon, and the	
				abnormal weather.	
0xf0f	0x98	Puppis		There's no way people could cause	
				a global scale disaster like this.	
				Good grief, cool your head.	
talk_Crux					
0xfd7	0x98	Crux		The truth is, it's already time to set sail, but,	
				due to the storms offshore, we can't	
				set sail.	
0x1055	0x6B	Crux		Ellipsis	
0x1087	0x98	Crux		...Somehow, this is really bad, right?	
0x10cd	0x98	Crux		If it continues like this, the storm will	
				get steadily worse and come this	
				way, and...!	
0x1142	0x6B	Crux		Sweatdrop	
0x1174	0x98	Crux		I-I might be overthinking things.	
				Hahaha...	
0x11e6	0x98	Crux		Even in a time like this,	
				the people of Remnant Island	
				won't panic...	
0x1249	0x98	Crux		Ooh, I've got to follow	
				their example a little more.	
0x12d2	0x98	Crux		That reminds me, even on Saint Cerize,	
				a huge monster appeared and is	
				causing a panic.	
0x1346	0x98	Crux		It took the full power of the	
				vigilante corps to finish it	
				off...	
0x13a5	0x98	Crux		Everywhere you look there's stories like that.	
0x141b	0x98	Crux		Though the Captain's strong,	
				he hasn't lifted a weapon	
				or an oar...	
0x147c	0x98	Crux		...In a situation like this,	
				it wonder how long it will continue.	
0x1512	0x98	Crux		Because of the abnormal weather,	
				the coastal currents have become	
				violent.	
0x157a	0x98	Crux		Sailing too has become difficult,	
				and it'll take twice as much time	
				as normal.	
0x15e6	0x98	Crux		...Well even so, the Captain	
				absolutely won't stop his ship.	
0x1669	0x98	Crux		So that this small island won't	
				be isolated, we'll brace	
				ourselves and launch the ship...	
0x16e0	0x98	Crux		Well, that's second hand	
				info from the Captain.	
talk_Axe					
0x17aa	0x98	Axe		Nayuta...	
				That's remarkable.	
0x17e4	0x98	Axe		You guys washed up on shore	
				a little while after the	
				abnormalities started.	
0x184c	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x1879	0x98	Axe		Though the open sea has become	
				stormy, I'm getting along.	
0x18d0	0x98	Axe		I've got to thank the gods.	
0x190a	0x98	NOI		(Master Kureha...	
				 She cast a spell on us	
				 so we would reach Remnant Island.)	
0x1974	0x98	ALTO		(Why in the world would she do	
				 something like that...?)	
0x19cb	0x98	ALTO		(...Kureha...)	
0x1a33	0x98	Axe		Though I'm glad you guys	
				are safe...	
0x1a75	0x98	Axe		The conditions around here	
				aren't safe to fish in.	
0x1ac5	0x98	Axe		Though it's not the case that I can't get any,	
				there's not many of them and I can't catch	
				as much as I usually do.	
0x1b54	0x98	Axe		Sometimes I catch fish from the deep	
				sea I haven't seen before...	
				I wonder just what's happening.	
0x1bfa	0x98	Axe		This strange weather can't be	
				good for fish health.	
0x1c4b	0x98	Axe		It's like all the fish somehow moved.	
				I wonder just what's happening.	
talk_Carina					
0x1cde	0x98	Carina		Nayuta...	
				Now that you've woken up,	
				you're all right.	
0x1d33	0x98	Carina		I was really worried about you.	
0x1d74	0x98	ALTO		Haha...I'm sorry.	
0x1da5	0x98	baby		Abu, abu...	
0x1dd0	0x98	NOI		Wawa...	
				You're not allowed to grab my hair!	
0x1e19	0x98	Carina		Huhu, it seems	
				Collie likes you,	
				Noi.	
0x1e5e	0x98	Carina		...Anyway, you two.	
				Get your bodies plenty of rest.	
0x1eb2	0x98	ALTO		...Yes.	mp_0002 0x90fc
0x1f01	0x98	baby		Abu, abu...	mp_0003c 0x1da5
0x1f2c	0x98	Carina		Huhu, it seems Collie likes you, Noi.	
0x1f73	0x98	Carina		...Anyway, you two.	mp_0003c 0x1e5e
				Get your bodies plenty of rest.	
talk_Bell					
0x1ff5	0x98	Bell		Because the fish have declined,	
				father goes out every day and	
				night to fish...	
0x2061	0x98	Bell		He works even more than	
				before, and can't be with me, but...	
0x20bc	0x6B	Bell		Ellipsis	
0x20ee	0x98	Bell		...Vel is fine!	
				Because Vel is helping father.	
0x213b	0x98	Bell		Because when Vel grows up...Vel will	
				be a fisherman like father!	
0x21c2	0x98	Bell		Vel will help father someday.	
0x21ff	0x98	Bell		Because when Vel grows up...Vel will	mp_0003c 0x213b
				be a fisherman like father!	
talk_Vavo					
0x22a4	0x98	Vavo		The phenomenon of rubble falling	
				like this should have ended, but...	
				With this, I do not think everything is over.	
0x2334	0x98	Vavo		As for the events that will happen after this...	
				As for predicting them, an examination	
				of the rubble may prove effective.	
0x23cc	0x98	Vavo		Especially at a time like this, it's	
				scholarship's time to shine. I will	
				do my very best.	
0x246b	0x98	Vavo		Precisely because of this unexplainable situation,	
				scholarship should be able to relieve some of	
				the anxiety.	
0x24f6	0x98	Vavo		Nayuta, thank you for your	
				support, as always.	
0x2579	0x98	Vavo		Hmm, that rubble has not hit	
				the museum is a silver lining.	
0x25d3	0x98	Vavo		However, from a research angle,	
				this is very intriguing...	
				If I investigate this thoroughly...	
0x264f	0x98	Vavo		...Whoops, that was indiscrete.	
				Sorry, it slipped out...	
0x26ce	0x98	Vavo		Mysterious ruins like these are not	
				only in the Ciencia Sea, but continue	
				to rain down throughout the world.	
0x2758	0x98	Vavo		There's heavy damage everywhere...	
				To be delighted at them is	
				an indiscretion.	
talk_Camelope					
0x280c	0x98	Camelope		I talked at length with Sasha, and she	
				decided to return once to the head	
				family.	
0x287f	0x98	Camelope		The company and trade of my	
				Camelope family is already famous...	
				We have plenty of reserve supplies.	
0x2905	0x98	Camelope		...I think I will return immediately	
				and release the stores.	
0x298c	0x98	Camelope		Though Sasha is concerned about her place...	
				On the contrary, I as family head must	
				convince her.	
0x2a0f	0x98	Camelope		Huhu, that girl has grown.	
0x2a69	0x98	Camelope		...Now, I think I will go and see	
				how she's doing.	
0x2abe	0x98	Camelope		I hope she is well, but...	
talk_Norma					
0x2b42	0x98	Norma		The hardness of will of the lady of the	
				house is famous among the relatives.	
0x2bae	0x98	Norma		Something like persuading her...	
				Ooh, milady has become a fine woman.	
0x2c13	0x98	Camelope		...Norma, I wonder what you are saying.	
0x2ca2	0x98	Norma		Huh!?	
				I-It was nothing!	
0x2d01	0x98	Norma		A-Anyhow, I will return	
				to the residence for now.	
0x2d52	0x98	Norma		Nayuta, you are heading off	
				to stop these abnormalities...	
				Please, take care of yourself.	
0x2e00	0x98	Norma		The mansion on the continent	
				is severely damaged, and I will	
				return to my parents home for now.	
0x2e7e	0x98	Norma		However, the lady of the house said	
				she was going to see how milady	
				was doing no matter what.	
0x2efa	0x98	Norma		Huhu, at a time like this,	
				she brought me too.	
0x2f70	0x98	Norma		Even so, in a situation like this,	
				I can't imagine the ferryboats	
				moving.	
0x2fd8	0x98	Norma		As for the continent, it is	
				truly in chaos...

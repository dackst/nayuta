0x1600d	0x98	ALTO	#18S#10x#400y	Kureha!

0x16211	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x16236	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Phew, thank goodness...	
				It seems nothing has happened.	
0x1628e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x162b4	0x98	Creha		Nothing...?	
0x162e8	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x16316	0x98	ALTO	#6A	No, there was just a little	
				something I worried about.	
0x1636e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Speaking of that,	
				what are you doing in a place like this?	
0x163d2	0x98	Creha		Yes...	
				I've been helping out with	
				various village tasks, but...	
0x16457	0x98	Creha		You know, it's because the moon	
				is beautiful.	
0x164a4	0x98	Creha		Even though Lyra gave me	
				an errand...	
				I stopped by here on the way.	
0x1650e	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	..................	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0x1656d	0x98	Creha		...What's wrong?	
0x165a6	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x165cc	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...No, it's nothing.	
0x16603	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Kureha, from the start,	
				I thought you had a mysterious	
				air about you, but...	
0x16678	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The truth is, we all	
				changed quite a bit.	
0x166ea	0x98	Creha	#0W	Huh...	
0x16803	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Certainly, you have great power	
				as one of the <Mythos>.	
0x1685c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	But, you used that power	
				to save Eartha,	
				and help the villagers...	
0x168bf	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x168e4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Inside of you, I feel like there	
				is a pure, kind heart.	
0x1693d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x16967	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It's the same as the people

				As a normal girl.

0x16a63	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ah, I'm sorry...	
				Something like this all of a sudden	
				was rude.	
0x16ae9	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x16b18	0x98	Creha		...No, that's not true.	
0x16b50	0x98	Creha		I've become used to it...	
				I'm sure that's thanks to you.	
0x16bce	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Huh...	mp_0001 0x166ea
0x16d59	0x98	Creha	#1W	...When I saw you in <Terra>,	
				I understood.	
0x16dbd	0x98	Creha	#1W	For Eartha's sake, you	
				frantically searched for the	
				<Yupina Grass>.	
0x16e41	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x16e76	0x98	Creha	#1W	No, it was even before that...	
				When you searched for the one	
				called Cygna and fought together with Noi.	
0x16f15	0x98	Creha		“#1WI want to do something for others”	
				...that feeling...	
0x16f97	0x06	Creha		ANI_NOD	
0x16fcb	0x98	Creha	#1W	I am sure that is what it

0x1702f	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x17064	0x98	ALTO	#2W#6A	For others...was it.	
				That might be true.	
0x170bf	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	The "Handyman Shop" that	
				Cygna created, that is its core	
				principle, isn't it...	
0x17132	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x1716e	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	Ahaha, on the contrary,	
				I am being taught.	
0x171e4	0x06	Creha		ANI_DENY	
0x17219	0x98	Creha	#2W	No, the reason I came to	
				this island is to confirm	
				that feeling...	
0x172b2	0x98	Creha	#1W	As I expected, it is	
				thanks to you, I think.	
0x173e9	0x6B	Creha		Ellipsis	
0x17493	0x98	Creha	#1W	──Thank you, Nayuta.

0x17781	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x177ab	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Anyway, I'm glad that

0x180a8	0x98	ALTO		It looks like the village is

0x18171	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Kureha, for now, I'll return	
				to where Noi is.	
0x181fc	0x06	Creha		ANI_NOD	
0x1822a	0x98	Creha		...Understood.	
				I will return to the bar inn.

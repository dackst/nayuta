0x1dd8	0x98	ALTO		Come to think of it, I feel like

0x1e45	0x98	ALTO		Are they a part of how the

0x35a4	0x98	NOI	#6A	But... I suspect they plan to shut down

0x362c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	The circumstances are the same as before,	
				so it's more than likely to be the case.	
0x3698	0x41	None	#0W#2E#029c	...Noi, and Nayuta, was it?

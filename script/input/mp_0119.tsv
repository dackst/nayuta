0x113c	0x98	ALTO	#0W	The wind sure is picking up...	
0x131e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_USE_SEXTANT	
0x13cd	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Is it... 87.61 degrees?	
				Then the average angle

0x1a62	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	Ah, Cygna.	
0x1b62	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x1be7	0x98	Signa	#1W	Don't 'Ah, Cygna' me.	
0x1c9b	0x98	Signa	#0W	You weren't in your room.	
				If you're even thinking ofâ”€	
0x1d24	0x98	Signa	#0W	I thought I told you	
				to get some proper	
				sleep for tonight.	
0x1d7d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1db5	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	No way, it's a beautiful night, so I	
				thought it'd be perfect for stargazing.	
0x1e40	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Now's the best time of year to	
				see the Summer Triangle clearly.

0x2287	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x2303	0x98	Signa	#0W	The captain said we should arrive	
				at Remnant Island by morning.	
0x2376	0x98	Signa	#0W	You'd better get some sleep now,

0x255e	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	Hmm... If this were the Academy's observatory,

0x269f	0x98	Signa	#1W	Damn it, you idiot...	
				Listen to your big bro, okay?	
0x26f0	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x276c	0x98	Signa	#0W	Your ability to concentrate on something	
				so hard over everything else around you	
				is usually one of your good traits.	
0x28d0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x292a	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Ahaha, sorry, my bad.	
0x298b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x29df	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Still, it's been about four	
				months since we last came	
				home to Remnant Island, huh?	
0x2a5f	0x98	ALTO	#0W	I hope Lyra, Master, and my	
				sister are all doing well.	
0x2acb	0x06	Signa		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2b04	0x98	Signa	#0W#6A	It's only been four months.	
				Nothing will have changed.	
0x2b65	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x2b9b	0x98	Signa	#1W#6A	We're finally coming home.	
				I'm planning to take it easy myself.	
0x2c0c	0x98	Signa		And I caught a lucky break, being	
				able to take a holiday from the city	
				guard in time for your break.	
0x2cf2	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Yeah, I guess so.	
0x2f74	0x40	ALTO		(Mom and Dad in heaven...	
				 Soon, I'll be returning to the island.)	
0x2fe0	0x40	ALTO		(My sister let me go to Saint Cerise Academy,
				 where I really have been learning something	
				 new every day.)	
0x305d	0x40	ALTO		(It's been so busy, I've barely been able to contact her...

0x32cb	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	...Look, Cygna!	
0x3370	0x98	Signa	#1W#6A	Oh...	
0x3693	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x378b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x37c3	0x98	ALTO	#0W#16S	...A meteor shower!	
0x380e	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Wow, how beautiful...	
				Hey, look! They're shooting	
				towards Remnant Island!	
0x3892	0x98	ALTO	#1W	Maybe there are star shards	
				in there too...!	
0x38f5	0x98	Signa	#1W	Yeah, I'm sure there are.	
				...Then again, it really	
				is a nice view.	
0x395f	0x98	Signa	#2W	Haha, perhaps the stars are	
				welcoming us home, too.	
0x3add	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x3b2e	0x98	ALTO	#0W	All right! I should record	
				these observations right away!	
0x3bd6	0x98	Signa	#0W	...No, Nayuta. I just told you,	
				if you don't get some sleep,	
				you'll feel it tomorrow.	
0x3c5b	0x98	Signa	#0W	Come on! Back to the cabin!	
0x3cbc	0xBC	ALTO		Coldsweat	
0x3d3d	0x98	ALTO	#0W#16S	Man, seriously...?	
0x3ef8	0x41	None	#1W#2E	There is an 'End' to this world...	mp_0100b 0x5696
				We have been taught this for as
				long as anyone can remember.#0E
0x3fbe	0x41	None	#1W#2E	Even the sea, which might look to stretch	mp_0101 0xd768
				towards infinity, has a definite end,
				beyond which one cannot travel.#0E
0x4087	0x41	None	#1W#2E	Because of this, many scholars will tell	
				you: 'This world is flat.' It is a pretty	
				conventional view about the world. #0E	
0x415e	0x41	None	#1W#2E	...Is that really true?	
				No... I'm sure it's not.#0E	
0x420a	0x41	None	#1W#2E	I strongly believe...	
				the world is much, much	
				bigger than that.#0E

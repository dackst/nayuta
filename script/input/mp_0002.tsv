0xc54	0x98	Aulbath		Please give that star shard	
				to Cygna when he awakens.	
0xcab	0x98	Aulbath		Just don't forget during what I'm	
				sure will be a joyous occasion...	
0xd06	0x98	Aulbath		And if you were ever to bring him	
				and Creha here again, I will 	
				welcome them back with open arms.	
0xd84	0x98	Aulbath		In the short time we had together,	
				I could only ever be a temporary	
				replacement for Zext.
0xdf5	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, please take care of them.	
0xe61	0x98	Aulbath		If you were to ever bring Cygna and	
				Creha here again, I will be sure	
				to welcome them back with open arms.	
0xedc	0x98	Aulbath		In the short time we had together,	mp_0002 0xd84
				I could only ever be a temporary
				replacement for Zext.
0xf4d	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, we're counting on you.	
0xfb4	0x98	ALTO		Oh, yeah... I should tell Master.	
0xffc	0x6B	Aulbath		Question	
0x1031	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, what is it?	
				You look happy for	
				some reason...	
0x1088	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, actually...	
0x10bc	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta explained the	
				situation to Orvus.	
0x1114	0x6B	Aulbath		Ellipsis	
0x1151	0x98	Aulbath		...For crying out loud...	
				That idiot son of mine!	
0x119c	0x98	Aulbath		Haha, while I was left here	
				worrying, you were sleeping	
				without a care in the world.	
0x1211	0x98	ALTO		Haha... It's just as you say.	
0x1251	0x98	Aulbath		...Nayuta, Noi.	
				Please wake him up.	
0x1296	0x98	Aulbath		As the father who raised him...	
				I must discipline him for his	
				dishonorable conduct.	
0x1317	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, leave it all to me!	mp_0000 0xfbcf
0x134b	0x98	NOI		We'll do our best.	
0x13b6	0x98	Aulbath		In fact, I intend to start	
				teaching swordsmanship	
				classes for children soon.	
0x1428	0x98	Aulbath		Once Cygna is awakened,	
				I will have him help me to repay	
				everything I've done for him.	
0x149d	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, Noi. Please take care of him.	
0x150c	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, Noi. Please take care of Cygna.	
0x1555	0x98	Aulbath		As the father who raised him...	mp_0002 0x1296
				I must discipline him for his
				dishonorable conduct.
0x160e	0x98	Aulbath		It's been over a year since	
				Cygna left. It feels like	
				it was only yesterday.	
0x167b	0x98	Aulbath		Heh, he left without saying goodbye...	
				He lacked manners to the very end.	
0x16e8	0x98	ALTO		Master...	
0x1711	0x98	Aulbath		...He went back to where he	
				came from. That is fine by me.	
0x1770	0x98	Aulbath		However, his days as	
				my son were no lie.	
0x17b9	0x98	Aulbath		I do not know when, but	
				the day will come when	
				we cross paths again...	
0x182c	0x98	Aulbath		I look forward to it.	
0x1870	0x98	ALTO		...Yeah, me too.	
0x18cd	0x98	Aulbath		Cygna's days as my	
				son were no lie.	
0x1911	0x98	Aulbath		One day our paths	
				will cross again...	
				I look forward to it.	
0x1a17	0x98	Aulbath		...Snow... on Remnant Island...	
0x1a6e	0x98	Aulbath		I pray this is not	
				an ill omen...	
0x1af2	0x98	Aulbath		Creha, was it...?	
				There's something strange	
				about that young lady...	
0x1b64	0x98	Aulbath		..................	
0x1bab	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x1bdd	0x98	Aulbath		Haha, don't worry about it.	
				It's not a huge concern.	
0x1c2f	0x98	Aulbath		She's your friend, right?	
				Make sure she feels welcome.	
0x1cc8	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, but as for that	
				damned son of mine...	
0x1d19	0x98	Aulbath		...I just have no	
				idea what to do...	
0x1d69	0x98	ALTO		(Of course, Master would	
				 be the one to realize	
				 that something's wrong.)	
0x1dbd	0x98	ALTO		(I've gotta find Cygna soon!)	
0x1e23	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, but as for that	mp_0002 0x1cc8
				damned son of mine...
0x1e74	0x98	Aulbath		...I just have no	mp_0002 0x1d19
				idea what to do...
0x1efa	0x98	Aulbath		I never would have anticipated someone	
				recovering from that demonic disease...	
				I am as shocked as can be.	
0x1f6c	0x98	Aulbath		The rumor is that you were	
				the one that supplied that	
				phantom Yupina Grass...	
0x1fc5	0x6B	Aulbath		Ellipsis	
0x1ffa	0x98	ALTO		Well, umm...	
				(That is pretty	
				 suspicious, huh?)	
0x2051	0x98	Aulbath		Heheh, well, I will overlook this	
				for now. Let us just celebrate	
				her successful recovery.	
0x20b4	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta, my student.
0x210b	0x98	ALTO		Haha... Thank you.	
0x2181	0x98	Aulbath		The rumor is that you were	mp_0002 0x1f6c
				the one that supplied that
				phantom Yupina Grass...
0x21da	0x98	Aulbath		...Heheh, I will not pry into it.	
				Above all, Eartha was saved.	
0x2248	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta, my student.	mp_0002 0x20b4
0x22c8	0x98	Aulbath		Well done, Nayuta, my student.	mp_0002 0x20b4
0x2320	0x98	Aulbath		For now, you should celebrate	
				your sister's recovery.	
0x23aa	0x98	Aulbath		I hear Eartha has	
				fallen ill recently.	
0x23fc	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, I had thought her	
				constitution seemed	
				rather frail lately...	
0x2454	0x98	Aulbath		She has a strong spirit, but	
				she has a tendency to hide	
				her own shortcomings.	
0x24ac	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, it is especially during times 
				like this that you should support her.	
0x24fd	0x98	ALTO		Yes...!	mp_0001 0xfd91
0x2549	0x98	Aulbath		She has a strong spirit, but	mp_0002 0x2454
				she has a tendency to hide
				her own shortcomings.
0x25a1	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, it is especially during times 	mp_0002 0x24ac
				like this that you should support her.
0x2628	0x98	Aulbath		This is not the first	
				time that Cygna has	
				run away from home.
0x2696	0x98	Aulbath		He used to always be doing things like	
				this as a child, though it has been a	
				long time since it last happened.	
0x2729	0x98	Aulbath		...But, it's been five years, huh?	
				Time flies, it seems...	
0x27c4	0x98	Aulbath		...It's been five years, huh?	
				Time flies, it seems...	
0x2883	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, I see you have returned	
				safely from the ruins...	
				I trust no one was seriously hurt?	
0x28f6	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yes. Neither of us	
				were seriously injured.	
0x2943	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm... That is good.	
0x297e	0x98	ALTO		(..It seems that we kept Noi a secret.	
				 There's no way we can tell him about	
				 the incident at the ruins or Terra.)	
0x2a09	0x98	Aulbath		For a moment, I sensed inside	
				those ruins an unusual presence...	
				It must have been my imagination.	
0x2a91	0x98	Aulbath		...I, too, must be getting old.	
0x2acc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop

				 If we're not careful, he's bound

				those ruins an unusual presence...
				It must have been my imagination.
0x2c3d	0x98	Aulbath		...I, too, must be getting old.
				I must redouble my training.	
0x2cb6	0x98	Aulbath		At any rate, if you need anything,	
				please speak with me immediately.	
0x2d16	0x98	Aulbath		I will train you anytime.	
0x2dc0	0x98	Aulbath		For goodness' sake, if Cygna	
				were here, this would have been	
				a better training session.	
0x2e25	0x98	Aulbath		Even though he joined the city guard,	
				his mind is still in its adolescence.
0x2e98	0x98	Aulbath		I must discipline	
				him for this soon.	
0x2f05	0x98	Aulbath		Life is about discipline...	
				Never neglect your training.	
0x2f60	0x98	Aulbath		Of course, we must rest, but people	
				learn to be lazy, and end up just	
				going through the motions.	
0x2fc6	0x98	Aulbath		...I shall remind Cygna	
				of that once again.	
0x303c	0x98	Aulbath		Life is about discipline...	mp_0002 0x2f05
				Never neglect your training.
0x3097	0x98	Aulbath		...I shall remind Cygna	mp_0002 0x2fc6

0x3109	0x98	Aulbath		Use that sword in your hands	
				to destroy those scarecrows.	
0x316e	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, I am sure you can regain	
				your instincts soon enough.	
0x322e	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, I see you have	
				equipped your sword.	
0x3278	0x98	Aulbath		Now, if you are ready,	
				speak to me once again.	
0x3300	0x07	System	#4C	Speak to Orvus using the □ button.	
0x3335	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, bother. Even though I asked

				to skip out on training...	
0x33ab	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, well. I can get a closer	
				look at you this time, Nayuta.	
0x3440	0x07	System	#4C	Equip weapons and armor by selecting

0x34ee	0x98	Aulbath		That Cygna, still running away.	
0x3531	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, it's been four months, but it 	
				seems he hasn't matured at all...	
0x3593	0x98	Aulbath		...Nayuta, whenever you are ready,	
				call on me once again.

0x3756	0x98	Pyxia		Gotta sketch this at once!	
0x37bf	0x98	Pyxia		Falling snow on an island of

0x3832	0x98	Pyxia		...Eek, the paper got wet!	
0x38a9	0x98	Pyxia		I can't decide what to

0x38fe	0x98	Pyxia		...See that old geezer over there?	
				He has a special atmosphere about him.	
0x3948	0x98	Pyxia		'The Master Swordsman Awaits His Nemesis.'

0x3c1b	0x98	Horolo		I'll have to ask Pyxia to preserve	
				this feeling in the painting.	
0x3c81	0x98	Horolo		Though the snow is pretty,	
				when it falls on this island,	
				it's definitely bizarre～!	
0x3cf3	0x98	Horolo		...If it sticks, maybe I	
				can make a snow sculpture.	
0x3d7b	0x98	Horolo		I think that man would make a	
				good model for a statue, too～.	
0x3ddc	0x98	Horolo		Heh, the beard part would	
				be pretty difficult, though.	
0x3e32	0x98	ALTO		(A statue of Master...?	
				 Feels as if just placing it somewhere
				 would grant protection from monsters.)	
0x3ed4	0x98	Horolo		I think that man would make a	mp_0002 0x3d7b

0x3f35	0x98	Horolo		If I asked, I wonder if he'd

0x4fcf	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	
				you will accumulate CHAIN and	
				gain various benefits.	
0x5043	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	
				With these benefits, you can very	
				much turn a fight in your favor.	
0x50da	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be interrupted	
				after a certain amount of time. It will	
				also be interrupted after taking damage.	
0x5161	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively, you will need	
				to cooperate with your allies to keep	
				your attacks from being interrupted.	
0x5207	0x98	Aulbath		There are more powerful	
				benefits of CHAIN.	
0x524e	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or more, the experience	
				you earn will increase. At 100 or more,	
				all sword attacks will be critical hits.	
0x52ea	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	
				you will gradually restore your health.	
0x5370	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate	
				that much, these benefits can be a	
				powerful ally in a tough battle.	
0x53f4	0x98	Aulbath		It is a good idea to keep this in mind,	
				and to fight actively when possible.	
0x5483	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash 'Spinning Cut,'	
				you can hit flying monsters.	
0x54e4	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch smaller monsters into	
				the air. If you can master it, you can gain	
				an advantage in your battles.	
0x5564	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible	
				to launch larger enemies.	
				Something to keep in mind.	
0x55fb	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	
				more powerful secret technique, 'Vacuum Blade.'	
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.	
0x56d6	0x98	Aulbath		'Down Thrust' is an attack that uses the	
				momentum of a fall to increase its power.	
0x5745	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is	
				that, of all the sword techniques,	
				it boasts the highest power.	
0x57ca	0x98	Aulbath		Although it can leave a wide opening,	
				there are many different ways to use it.	
				You can try finding them out on your own.	
0x586f	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	
				more powerful secret technique, 'Meteor Attack.'		
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x594e	0x98	Aulbath		'Kamaitachi' unleashes an	
				intense stroke of your sword	
				with a quick step.	
0x59bc	0x98	Aulbath		This technique, infused with sword chi,	
				can damage enemies against which sword	
				attacks are otherwise ineffective.	
0x5a43	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, its power lies in its	
				longer reach. It is possible to attack	
				from a distance with this technique.	
0x5afd	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	
				more powerful secret technique, 'Divine Wind.'	
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x5bd8	0x98	Aulbath		'Swallow Return' can cut down all	
				surrounding enemies in an instant.	
0x5c40	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling the enemies	
				towards you. This is very powerful in melee.	
0x5ccc	0x98	Aulbath		It is one of the most difficult sword techniques,	
				but if mastered, it can be a powerful tool.	
				Never tire, and keep practicing.	
0x5da1	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	
				more powerful secret technique, 'Fallen Lotus.'		
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x5e7f	0x98	Aulbath		There exist two types of swords:	
				One-handed and two-handed swords.	
0x5ee4	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords have great maneuverability, and	
				are capable of delivering quick, successive attacks.	
				Generally, they are considered easier to handle.	
0x5f82	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have higher power,	
				and easily knock down enemies. However, they leave a	
				larger opening between attacks and are harder to handle.	
0x6051	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	
				I cannot say which is superior. Choose a	
				sword most comfortable for you to use.	
0x610c	0x98	Aulbath		Some monsters can cause	
				various status conditions.	
0x6176	0x98	Aulbath		'Poison' rapidly saps your health, and	
				'paralysis' greatly slows your movement...	
0x6205	0x98	Aulbath		'Freezing' can stop your movements.	
				'Panic' derails your actions.	
0x6275	0x98	Aulbath		Though all can be reversed with time,	
				there exists equipment that improves	
				resistance and status recovery items.	
0x62fc	0x98	Aulbath		If you are heading to a dangerous	
				battle, make sure to be prepared.

0x6676	0x98	Aulbath		Use that sword in your hands	mp_0002 0x3109

0x66db	0x98	Aulbath		It will be difficult to destroy the

0x6746	0x98	Aulbath		Nayuta, I am sure you can regain	mp_0002 0x316e

0x6844	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, it seems that you

0xe902	0x98	Aulbath		If you have time, will you accept?	
0xe951	0x98	Aulbath		You two, you've come at a good time.	
0xe998	0x98	Aulbath		As a matter of fact, I have	
				a special favor to ask of you.	
0xe9f6	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xea20	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It's rare for you to	
				need a favor, Master.	
0xea6e	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xea97	0x98	NOI	#6A	Did something happen?	
0xeace	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_NOD	
0xeaf6	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, the truth is, it has	
				something to do with Terra.	
0xeb44	0x98	Aulbath		If you have time, will you accept?	mp_0002 0xe902
0xebc9	0x36	Choice		[Accept]	mp_0000 0xeaf5
0xebdf	0x36	Choice		[Quit]	mp_0000 0xeb0b
0xec7e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_OJIGI	
0xeca5	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I'm sorry, I have something	
				else to do right now...	
0xecf8	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT3	
0xed22	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, if that's the case,	
				then it can't be helped.	
0xed74	0x98	Aulbath		Please, come back when	
				it is more convenient.	
QS_81_undertake
0xef1d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0xef45	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yes, nothing comes above my	
				Master's request. Please, go	
				on and we'll take care of it.	
0xefcf	0x98	Aulbath		Heheh, I am in your debt.	
0xf00a	0x98	Aulbath		Though it's sudden, first,	
				please accept this.

0xf0d3	0xC1	System		obtained.	mp_0000 0x7558
0xf204	0x06	ALTO		ANI_HANDOVER1	
0xf286	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What's this...?	
0xf2b1	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0xf2d7	0x98	NOI	#6A	A little box?	
0xf305	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xf332	0x98	Aulbath		It's been six years now...	
				This fell nearby the day	
				I found young Cygna.	
0xf395	0x98	Aulbath		I was distracted by him at the	
				time, so I stowed it away	
				without a second thought, but...	
0xf3f4	0x98	Aulbath		Recently, I found it again while	
				sorting through Cygna's belongings.	
0xf44c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It's...	
0xf479	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm... This box doesn't	
				seem to have a keyhole.	
0xf508	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0xf52d	0x98	ALTO		There's a lid, but	
				it won't budge...	
				How do we open this?	
0xf590	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_THINK	
0xf5ba	0x98	Aulbath		I have tried everything,	
				but I cannot figure it out.	
0xf60f	0x98	Aulbath		It seems to be made of some	
				strange metal. I could not	
				even scratch it.	
0xf6ad	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT2	
0xf6d7	0x98	Aulbath		So, I thought you two could	
				figure out how to open it.	
0xf75e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see... So that's	
				what you wanted.	
0xf7a1	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm, but we don't even	
				have a single clue...	
0xf7f4	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xf826	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Huh, if I look closely at the box...	
				Doesn't it look like some kind of	
				writing is engraved in it?	
0xf8a9	0x98	NOI	#6A	That's... the ancient	
				script of the Mitos...?	
0xf911	0x98	Aulbath		Perhaps it contains a	
				hint for opening the box.	
0xf968	0x98	Aulbath		Noi, you can read	
				that writing, no?	
0xf9b7	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0xf9db	0x98	NOI	#6A	I-I can try.	
				...Ehem, umm...	
0xfa30	0x98	NOI	#6A	'This box is sealed	mp_0002 0x6499
				 with four locks.'
0xfa77	0x98	NOI	#6A	'If you wish to release the locks,	mp_0002 0x64e4
				 offer up this box in order of the seasons,
				 with them changed as they should be...'
0xfb18	0x98	NOI	#6A	That's what it looks	
				like is written.	
0xfbb3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0xfbe3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0xfc17	0x98	ALTO		Four locks...	
				And we have to offer it up	
				as the seasons change?	
0xfc74	0x98	ALTO		Ignoring the first half for now,	
				I don't get what it means by 'offer	
				it up in order of the seasons.'	
0xfcef	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xfd18	0x98	NOI	#6A	It probably means to shower	
				it in the astral power most	
				attuned to each season.	
0xfd88	0x98	NOI	#6A	The Mitos created a device called	
				the Astrolabe that is able to to	
				control the seasons...	
0xfddb	0x98	NOI	#6A	I guess this was made using	
				the same kind of technology.	
0xfe24	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0xfe5f	0x98	ALTO		Hmm... After going through the trouble	
				of setting up something like that, there	
				must be something important inside.	
0xfee1	0x98	ALTO		...But, what can we do?	
				We can't manipulate	
				astral power.	
0xff42	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xff6b	0x98	NOI	#6A	All right, then...	
0xffa2	0x98	NOI	#6A	Then we should probably search	
				for the 'power stations' of	
				astral power.	
0x1000d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x10037	0x98	ALTO		'Power stations?'	
0x1007e	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_THINK	
0x100a8	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm... It sounds like they are a	
				place where power congregates.		
0x1012c	0x98	NOI	#6A	It's a part of the knowledge	
				the old Noi passed down to me.
0x10190	0x98	NOI	#6A	In each of Terra's four continents, there	
				are places where the astral power is	
				stronger than the surrounding area...	
0x10230	0x98	NOI	#6A	If we use places like that,	
				we can simulate changing	
				the seasons for the device.
0x102c3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GOODIDEA	
0x102ed	0x98	ALTO		I see, if we take the	
				box to those places...	
0x10338	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x10360	0x98	ALTO		But where are they...?	
0x103be	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x103f0	0x98	ALTO		(Speaking of which... During my	
				 adventures last year, I saw devices that	
				 react to the seasons a few times...)	
0x10476	0x98	ALTO		(Those places on each continent where	
				 the wardens were imprisoned...	
				 Could they be...?)	
0x104f0	0x98	ALTO		(And, 'changed as they should be?')	
0x10539	0x98	ALTO		(The proper order of the seasons...	
				 ...Maybe we'll need to put some	
				 thought into this.)	
0x105bc	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT3	
0x105e6	0x98	Aulbath		Heheh, you seem to	
				have an idea, Nayuta.	
0x10632	0x98	Aulbath		Let me know if you manage	
				to open the box. It has	
				bothered me for so long.	
0x106ba	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x106df	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yeah, I'm curious about	
				what's in the box, too...	
				I'm looking forward to it.	
0x10776	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x1079b	0x98	ALTO		Let's try it out, Noi.	
0x107ec	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x10810	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah, okay.	mp_0000 0x1b27a
0x10876	0x07	System	#3C	Quest [Locked Box] started!	
QS_81_quest_end
0x10c06	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, Nayuta.	
				Did you...?	
0x10c42	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x10c6a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yeah, we managed to	
				release the locks on 
				the Locked Box.	
0x10ccd	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let me give it to you.	
0x10d35	0x06	ALTO		ANI_HANDOVER	
0x10d8b	0x40	UNDEF		Handed over the Locked Box.	
0x10e4a	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x10e73	0x98	NOI	#6A	Master, get on with it	
				and open it up already!	
0x10ecf	0x98	Aulbath		Heheh, don't be so worked up.	
0x10f72	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_HAVE_A_BOX	
0x10ffb	0x98	Aulbath		Let's see...	
0x1102a	0x40	UNDEF		Orvus slowly opened the lid of the box.	
0x11072	0x40	UNDEF		Inside the box was a small star shard.	
0x110c5	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x110f7	0x6B	NOI		Ellipsis	
0x11128	0x6B	Aulbath		Ellipsis	
0x1115d	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x11183	0x98	NOI		A star shard...?	
0x111b8	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, this is...	
				What does it project?	
0x11226	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x11250	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Should I ask my sister	
				to examine it with her	
				observation machine?	
0x1131c	0x06	Aulbath		ANI_WAIT	
0x11380	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0x113a5	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm... Please do.	
0x1142a	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta and the others decided to head to the	
				Herschels' house. They explained the situation	
				to Eartha, who performed the star shard analysis.	
EV_2_S04_under_noi
0x11760	0x98	ALTO		(...In the end, Cygna wasn't	
				 on Remnant Island.)	
0x117b0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x117d8	0x98	ALTO		(It's hard to imagine that he	
				 would get mistaken for someone	
				 else in such a small village.)	
0x1183f	0x98	ALTO		(Maybe he had already left by the	
				 time we arrived in the Garden...)	
0x118b5	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x118e7	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x1190d	0x98	ALTO		Speaking of which...	
				Noi is still waiting, isn't she?	
0x11979	0x98	ALTO		I left without saying anything...	
				I should go back to Terra.	
0x11ab9	0xCE	Objective		Looks like Cygna's not here. I should return to Terra for Noi.

0xdd2	0x98	Volans		Noi... You've come back to us!?	
0xe21	0x98	Volans		How about now? Are you willing	
				to let me conduct experiments	
				on your body now?	
0xe8a	0x98	NOI		I-I'm, uh, gonna have to pass on that.	
0xec4	0x98	ALTO		(Same as always...)	
0xf21	0x98	Volans		Heh, it has been quite some time since	
				we've seen each other, Baron, my friend...	
				You look better than ever.	
0xf9b	0x98	Volans		After what happened during last	
				year's events, it seems the times	
				are changing for the better.	
0x1045	0x98	Volans		After the abnormalities ended,	
				the storm at the End of the World	
				cleared up in a flash of light.	
0x10d7	0x98	Volans		And beyond, we found the	
				rest of the world...	
0x1131	0x98	Volans		Though it's already been a year since then,	
				researchers everywhere are still very busy.	
0x119c	0x98	Volans		I am almost annoyed at my being	
				asked for help at every moment.	
0x11f6	0x98	ALTO		Haha... Well, it is understandable.	
				The conventional wisdom about the world	
				was suddenly turned on its head, after all.	
0x1270	0x98	ALTO		From now on, I can only wonder what	
				will happen to the Ciencia Sea...	
				As well as the rest of our world.	
0x12da	0x98	Volans		There's no way of knowing...	
				No matter how much research you do,	
				no one can determine the future.	
0x1341	0x98	Volans		I am sure that is for you	
				young ones to decide.	
0x138c	0x98	ALTO		...I agree.	
0x13f6	0x98	Volans		The storm at the End of the World has cleared	
				up, and we've found the rest of the world...	
				Our conventional wisdom has been overturned.	
0x148b	0x98	Volans		The future of this sea will be decided	
				by young ones such as yourself.	
0x14e3	0x98	Volans		Heh, of course, I am committed to	
				still continuing my research.	
				I do not intend to lose to the young.	
0x158d	0x98	Volans		The future of this sea will be decided	mp_0115 0x148b
				by young ones such as yourself.	
0x15e5	0x98	Volans		Heh, of course, I am committed to	
				still continuing my research.

				Allow me to thank you.	
0x17c9	0x98	Volans		Now, I'm sure humanity will require much	
				time in order to right its wrongs...	
0x1830	0x98	Volans		As for the message on the stone tablets,	
				I will keep it here. Please let me know	
				if you wish to read it again.	
0x1951	0x98	Volans		The world is in turmoil, and the	
				Empire and other nations of the	
				continent are at the brink of war.	
0x19dd	0x98	Volans		However, conversely, if we manage to get	
				through this chaos somehow, you would think	
				we should also be able to stop the war.	
0x1a70	0x98	Volans		...If I can put together the truth of these	
				abnormalities and publish them with the Baron's	
				connections, then it should be possible.	
0x1af9	0x98	Volans		Hehe, we must do all	
				that is in our power.	
0x1b67	0x98	Volans		...If I can put together the truth of these	
				abnormalities and publish them with the Baron's	
				connections we could relieve some of the chaos.	
0x1c07	0x98	Volans		Hehe, there is nothing more satisfying than	
				being able to influence the world with a	
				single paper. I shall do my best to help.	
0x1caf	0x98	Volans		Where you are heading now... I am sure all	
				the answers are waiting for you there.	
0x1d18	0x98	Volans		As a scientist, it is frustrating	
				that I cannot go with you...	
0x1d78	0x98	Volans		I look forward to hearing your	
				stories upon your safe return.	
0x1e02	0x98	Volans		As a scientist, it is frustrating	mp_0115 0x1d18

0x1e62	0x98	Volans		I look forward to hearing your	mp_0115 0x1d78
				stories upon your safe return.	
0x1efa	0x98	Volans		Though Noi explained everything to me, such	
				as the whole other world on the moon...	
0x1f81	0x98	Volans		In fact, had I not seen what	
				Noi spoke of with my own eyes,	
				I never would have believed it.	
0x1ffd	0x98	Volans		It feels like everything I know is wrong.	
				Ah, what a wonderful feeling...	
0x206b	0x98	Volans		...Oh, I'm sorry. I got	
				carried away, didn't I?	
0x20e8	0x98	Volans		Anyway, I will continue my research	
				to attempt to get a clearer picture	
				of this situation.	
0x215b	0x98	Volans		Let me know if you find anything.	
0x21d8	0x98	Volans		I never thought that a being	
				with such power beyond human	
				understanding could exist...	
0x224d	0x98	Volans		It is a little too far removed from	
				reality for me to believe my eyes.	
0x22b4	0x98	Volans		...Anyway, we will do	
				what we can to help.	
0x22fb	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, please do your best.	
0x2360	0x98	Volans		I never thought that a being	mp_0115 0x21d8
				with such power beyond human	
				understanding could exist...	
0x23d5	0x98	Volans		...Anyway, we will do	
				what we can to help.	
				Do your best, Nayuta.	
0x246e	0x98	Volans		Hmm, it is getting cold.	
				It is like the winter in	
				my homeland, the Empire.	
0x24de	0x98	Volans		I am from the northern reaches of the Empire.	
				This degree of cold is not unusual there.	
				Of course I know how to deal with this.	
0x2587	0x98	Volans		Ha ha ha, if you are cold,	
				wear heavier clothing, Nayuta.	
0x2600	0x98	Volans		I am from the northern reaches of the Empire.	mp_0115 0x24de
				This degree of cold is not unusual there.	
				Of course I know how to deal with this.	
0x26a9	0x98	Volans		If you are cold, wear	
				heavier clothing, Nayuta.	
0x2727	0x98	Volans		In the Ciencia Sea, sometimes parts	
				of ruins fall from the sky...	
0x278a	0x98	Volans		I once retrieved two separate fragments of	
				such ruins that fell at different locations.	
0x27e0	0x98	Volans		I compared the two, and	
				they were a perfect match.	
0x2838	0x98	ALTO		Huh, so what does that mean...?	
0x286f	0x98	Volans		Hehe, I suppose we could think of	
				it as a single ruin crumbling and	
				falling in different places.	
0x28d9	0x98	Volans		However, the two drop sites	
				are the northern and southern	
				ends of the Ciencia Sea.	
0x2950	0x98	Volans		One theory is that the ruins are	
				the ancient remains of what was	
				destroyed by the Calamity.	
0x29cd	0x98	Volans		But that still does not explain this.	
				...I wish I could solve the whole	
				mystery with my own two hands somehow.	
0x2a82	0x98	Volans		The ruins that fall from the sky, by	
				one theory, are the ancient remains	
				of what was destroyed by the Calamity.	
0x2b0f	0x98	Volans		Even if this is so, it leaves	
				many things still unexplained.	
0x2b53	0x98	Volans		But this 'Remnant Island,' created by	
				an accumulation of ruins, may hold some	
				clue to unraveling this mystery...	
0x2beb	0x98	Volans		Hehe, that is what I believe.	
0x2c50	0x98	Volans		In regards to the falling ruins phenomenon,	
				it is still a source of constant debate	
				within the academic community.	
0x2cd8	0x98	Volans		Hehe, if possible, I would like to discover	
				the truth with my own two hands.	
0x2d70	0x98	Volans		...Though I am more than pleased to	
				hear that your sister has recovered...	
0x2dda	0x98	Volans		That medicinal herb was supposed to be extinct.	
				On a remote island like this, there's no way you	
				could have obtained some in such a short time.	
0x2e82	0x98	Volans		Unless... star shards, this island's	
				specialty, and the brilliant world	
				projected from within them...	
0x2f1c	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, could you... Could you have	
				some relation to Lost Heaven...?	
0x2f89	0x6B	Volans		Ellipsis	
0x2fbd	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x2fef	0x98	ALTO		Umm, well, uh...	mp_0110 0x11d08
0x3020	0x98	Volans		...Hehe, well, whatever.	
				If that is indeed so, we	
				will find out soon enough.	
0x308b	0x98	Volans		Perhaps then YOU can become the	
				ultimate subject of my research.	
0x30e1	0x98	Volans		Mwhaha... Ahahahaha!	
0x3119	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x314b	0x98	ALTO		(Hmm, it looks like I pressed	
				 one of his buttons somehow...)	
0x31c9	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, could you...	
				From Lost Heaven...	
0x3224	0x98	Volans		Perhaps then YOU can become the	mp_0115 0x308b
				ultimate subject of my research.	
0x327a	0x98	Volans		Mwhaha... Ahahahaha!	mp_0115 0x30e1
0x32e8	0x98	Volans		The Yupina Grass herb	
				is already extinct.	
0x334b	0x98	Volans		...To put it bluntly, it would	
				be all but impossible to obtain	
				any more of it today.	
0x33c8	0x98	Volans		It may sound cruel, but...	
				Do not get your hopes up.	
0x3445	0x98	Volans		The Yupina Grass herb	mp_0115 0x32e8
				is already extinct.	
0x34a8	0x98	Volans		Unless some miracle happens...	
				It would be impossible to obtain.	
0x3594	0x98	Volans		Heh, the Baron is	
				a little thick.	
0x35dd	0x98	Volans		A carefree work environment is the	
				first step in advancing research.	
0x364e	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, you know this	
				too, don't you?	
0x3693	0x98	ALTO		(It depends...)	
0x3707	0x98	Volans		By opening this museum,	
				my research will progress.	
0x375c	0x98	Volans		A carefree work environment is	
				what we scientists need most!	
0x37f2	0x98	Volans		By the way, Nayuta.	
				Your family name	
				is Herschel...	
0x3847	0x98	Volans		Your father wouldn't happen to	
				be an astronomer, by any chance?	
0x389a	0x6B	ALTO		Exclamation	
0x38cc	0x98	ALTO		Yes, that's true, but...	
				You knew my father!?	
0x3924	0x98	Volans		Only his name.	
0x3954	0x98	Volans		As I recall, he was the one who first	
				proposed a connection between the End	
				of the World and Lost Heaven.	
0x39d7	0x98	Volans		He hypothesized that the other	
				world, Lost Heaven, might exist	
				beyond the End of the World.	
0x3a4c	0x98	Volans		My specialty is archaeology and natural history,	
				so it's a bit of a different field, but...	
				His paper was very interesting to read.	
0x3aed	0x98	ALTO		I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x3b1a	0x98	ALTO		But I heard that his hypothesis was never	
				accepted by the academic community...	
0x3b97	0x98	Volans		Hehe, scientific progress	
				is an ever evolving thing.	
0x3bdc	0x98	Volans		There have been countless hypotheses	
				proposed that try to explain the state of	
				the world. It all will be settled someday.	
0x3c77	0x98	Volans		Wouldn't you agree?	
0x3cbb	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0x3ced	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yes!	mp_0002 0xd4f0
0x3d13	0x98	ALTO		(One day, definitely, I will...)	
0x3d53	0x98	Volans		Hahaha...! It seems you are	
				a natural-born scientist.	
0x3ddf	0x98	Volans		My reason for being here is to discover	
				the true nature of the ruins that fall	
				into the Ciencia Sea and Remnant Island.	
0x3e68	0x98	Volans		My research interests also include	
				Lost Heaven and the End of the World.	
0x3ed6	0x98	Volans		In particular, the End of the World's	
				existence is widely assumed, but has	
				never been directly confirmed.	
0x3f50	0x98	Volans		A raging, pitch-black storm is said	
				to be at the End of the World...	
				Who knows what is on the other side?	
0x3fdd	0x98	Volans		Heh, perhaps it will be young people	
				like you who will set forth a new way	
				of thinking about the world.	
0x406f	0x98	Volans		...Hehe, I never thought I'd	
				meet someone here on this island	
				who I could talk to like this!	
0x40df	0x98	Volans		Nayuta, you are quite an interesting	
				young man. Once again, I expect great	
				things from you in the future.

0x7583	0x98	Caelum		Coron was asked to present her paper

0x7607	0x98	Caelum		She was able to write a great paper based

				Hehe, that's my twin sister.	
0x76de	0x98	Caelum		Professor Volans is currently analyzing

0x775a	0x98	Caelum		He plans to compile them into a thesis to send to every

0x79a7	0x98	Caelum		I hear that you two protected a

0x7a08	0x98	Caelum		Hehe, that's my Nayuta! ㈱	
				Keep up the good work!	
0x7a68	0x98	Caelum		Though all we can do is research,

0x7bfa	0x98	Caelum		Hiya, Nayuta.	
				Long time no see!	
0x7c37	0x98	Caelum		I've been so confused by all the	
				unbelievable things that have	
				happened in the last few days...	
0x7ca2	0x98	Caelum		The people of this island	
				seem to be working hard	
				every day to get by.	
0x7d1c	0x98	Caelum		They're strong. We should learn	
				to follow their example!	
0x7d97	0x98	Caelum		The other day, they brought us	
				fish and vegetables, even though	
				we didn't ask for them.	
0x7e09	0x98	Caelum		I'm glad I came to this	
				island. It's a nice place.	
0x7e9f	0x98	Caelum		I can't believe some monstrous old dude

0x7ef6	0x98	Caelum		And what's more, he even

0x7f5a	0x98	Caelum		...Don't lose heart, Nayuta.	
				I'm sure we'll do something.	
0x7fdc	0x98	Caelum		He even kidnapped that Creha girl...

				I'm sure we'll do something.	
0x80b1	0x98	Caelum		Hmm... It's kind of chilly in here...	
0x80ee	0x98	Caelum		Maybe it's because I just changed my clothes.	
				But it feels strangely sinister...	
0x8153	0x98	Caelum		Coron and I have	
				cold sensitivity.	
0x81be	0x98	Caelum		It's kind of chilly in here...

0x82ca	0x98	Caelum		Caelum said I'd get used to it	
				before long, but it's impossible.	
0x832b	0x98	Caelum		I wanna go back to my

0x83a5	0x98	Caelum		Give them back, Caelum...

0x850a	0x98	Caelum		...That Caelum...	
				You know, sometimes she forces

0x856f	0x98	Caelum		Every time, she dresses me up like this...

0x8600	0x98	Caelum		...That Caelum...	mp_0115 0x850a
				You know, sometimes she forces

0x8665	0x98	Caelum		Caelum's glasses...	
				They're so weak, I can

0x8711	0x98	Caelum		I never would have guessed that

0x8755	0x98	Caelum		...Nayuta, hang in there.	
				There's always hope.	
0x87a7	0x98	Caelum		Would the gods abandon

0x88f9	0x98	Caelum		Oh, do you need something	
				from Professor Volans?	
0x8945	0x98	Caelum		He's right over there,	
				why not ask him?	
0x89c9	0x98	Caelum		It looks like Baron Victor came	
				to see us from the Empire.	
0x8a19	0x98	Caelum		Since our time in the Empire,	
				he's always been sent to	
				chaperone Professor Volans.	
0x8a82	0x98	Caelum		...What an unfortunate	
				duty for him!	
0x8aef	0x98	Caelum		The Baron was forced to chaperone	
				Professor Volans in the Empire as well.	
0x8b4b	0x98	Caelum		Hehe, that's why the two of them	
				seem to get along so well.	
0x8bf4	0x98	Caelum		Hmm, it was a good decision to follow	
				Professor Volans here after all.	
0x8c5a	0x98	Caelum		I'm just happy to have met	
				a cute boy like Nayuta in a	
				remote place like this. ㈱	
0x8ccd	0x98	Caelum		We actually have two more members	
				of the research team, but Vavo	
				is out of town...	
0x8d33	0x98	Caelum		And Coron is very shy～!	
0x8d69	0x98	Caelum		...She's my younger twin sister,	
				but she's never been very good	
				at socializing.	
0x8dff	0x98	Caelum		We haven't collected any items for	
				the exhibits. Most of the exhibition	
				rooms are closed right now.	
0x8e6f	0x98	Caelum		We're planning on opening each room	
				to the public once we have a few

0x9343	0x98	Caelum		Coron, shouldn't you dress	
				a little more fashionably?	
0x939d	0x98	Caelum		You need to look more presentable.	
				You'll embarrass yourself at the

0x940d	0x98	Coron		Ugh, ooh... You may be right...

talk_Coron					
0x9594	0x98	Coron		Though I'm happy to be able	
				to publish my paper...	
0x95dc	0x98	Coron		Of course, I can't go around	
				dressed like Caelum～...	
0x966d	0x98	Coron		At Professor Volans' suggestion, I have been	
				studying the behavior of marine life in the	
				vicinity of this island in great detail.	
0x96fa	0x98	Coron		The natural instincts of the animals could	
				help us identify locations that are safe	
				even in the event of a major disaster...	
0x9787	0x98	Coron		As expected from the professor...	
				He has a unique way of looking at things.	
0x980f	0x98	Coron		At Professor Volans' suggestion, I have been	mp_0115 0x966d
				studying the behavior of marine life in the	
				vicinity of this island in great detail.	
0x989c	0x98	Coron		If all goes well, we could find safe	
				places to escape to in case of disaster.	
				I've got to do my best...	
0x995b	0x98	Coron		With Creha being kidnapped,	
				the attack seems to be over...	
0x99b9	0x98	Coron		But is it really okay	
				to continue researching	
				on this island like this?	
0x9a24	0x98	Coron		It makes me want to go back	
				home to the Empire...	
0x9aa9	0x98	Coron		Creha was kidnapped, and we don't	
				know anything about who did it...	
0x9aff	0x98	Coron		Is it really okay to	
				continue researching on	
				this island like this...?	
talk_Vavo					
0x9bb4	0x98	Vavo		I'm still amazed by the way	
				Professor Volans thinks.	
0x9c05	0x98	Vavo		However... at the same time,	
				I feel hopeless about	
				these anomalies.	
0x9c78	0x98	Vavo		No matter where you go, you can't escape...	
				I can't help but feel that way.	
0x9d06	0x98	Vavo		I feel hopeless about	
				these anomalies.	
0x9d5e	0x98	Vavo		No matter where you go, you can't escape...	mp_0115 0x9c78
				I can't help but feel that way.	
0x9e03	0x98	Vavo		During the attack, the museum	
				acted as an emergency shelter.	
0x9e5d	0x98	Vavo		The professor and I guided the islanders to safety,	
				and most of them managed to escape, but...	
0x9ecd	0x98	Vavo		In the end, that Zext man was	
				only after Creha, wasn't he...?	
0x9f54	0x98	Vavo		In the end, that Zext man was	mp_0115 0x9ecd
				only after Creha, wasn't he...?	
0x9fb3	0x98	Vavo		I'm a failure for not being	
				able to protect her...	
talk_Victor

				last seen Professor Volans.	
0xa0ac	0x98	Victor		It's already been a year

				Time goes by fast.	
0xa127	0x98	Victor		Reconstruction is underway, and	
				the situation in the Empire has	
				calmed down considerably.	
0xa1a2	0x98	Victor		I'm sure it will be soon when we can say	
				that a true sense of peace has returned.

0xa397	0x98	Victor		The nobility of the Empire has heavily	
				invested in the professor's research...	
0xa3f0	0x98	Victor		I have come here myself on orders from the	
				prince to inspect the fruits of his labor...	
				Alas, Professor Volans is an eccentric.	
0xa482	0x98	Victor		All I can do is let him do what he	
				wants. Hopefully he will not serve	
				as a detriment to our country.	
talk_Victor_and_Volans					
0xa512	0x98	Victor		When the Empire heard you went through the trouble	
				of moving your research lab all the way out to	
				Remnant Island, we had to come take a look.	
0xa589	0x98	Victor		Professor Volans... What in the world are	
				you thinking by opening this museum?	
0xa5df	0x98	Victor		How can this possibly contribute	
				to the future of our country?	
0xa65c	0x98	Volans		Hahaha... Baron, what do I	
				care about the Empire?	
0xa6a0	0x98	Volans		I am conducting this research	
				for my own personal interest.	
0xa704	0x98	Victor		Wh-What!? That is a	
				little problematic...	
0xa75b	0x98	Volans		Hahahahaha.	
0xa788	0x6B	Victor		Sweatdrop	
0xa7bc	0x98	Victor		D-Don't just laugh it off	
				and dodge the question.	
talk_Pecula					
0xa88e	0x98	Pecula		Idyllic and lush in nature...	
				This is truly a beautiful island.	
0xa8fb	0x98	Pecula		My husband is currently working	
				to make our home the Empire a	
				similarly nice place to live.	
0xa964	0x98	Pecula		Hehe, I couldn't be more	
				proud to be his wife.	
0xa9d7	0x98	Pecula		My husband is currently working	mp_0115 0xa8fb

				similarly nice place to live.	
0xaa40	0x98	Pecula		Hehe, I couldn't be more	mp_0115 0xa964
				proud to be his wife.	
0xaac1	0x98	Pecula		My husband came to Remnant Island	
				to meet an acquaintance, and I	
				thought of coming with him.	
0xab40	0x98	Pecula		But... being unable to control a man	
				of such low ranking is just pathetic.	
0xab96	0x98	Pecula		Hmph. In the end, his rank of Baron is	
				merely a sham. He's of no import whatsoever.	
0xac35	0x98	Pecula		The way my husband lets others exert	
				such control over him is pathetic.	
0xaca1	0x98	Pecula		Well, now that we have come all this way,	
				what's the harm in letting the commoners	
				show us their way of life?	
talk_Equlea					
0xad66	0x98	Equlea		It has been a long time since my	
				family has traveled together.	
0xadc5	0x98	Equlea		So much has happened the last few days	
				that I've hardly had time to play...	
0xae34	0x98	Equlea		This time for sure, I want to make	
				some good memories for myself.	
0xaec1	0x98	Equlea		I will try to make friends	
				with the village children.	
0xaf17	0x98	Equlea		I wonder if they will	
				let me join them...	
0xaf94	0x98	Equlea		(Mother... I wish you would

0x13242	0x41	None	#2E#0W	...It has been many months	
				since Terra left the planet...	
				The two Mitos children abandoned	
				their mission and went off to sleep.	
					
				Before long, I, too, will	
				enter a lasting slumber.#0E	
0x13347	0x41	None	#2E#0W	But first...	
				I shall note the true facts as	
				to why the planet was destroyed.	
				In the future, if by some chance,	
				the day comes when human survivors	
				from the surface set foot in Terra...	
				 	
				I hope this will serve as a reminder 	
				against making the same mistakes.#0E	
0x13473	0x41	None	#2E#0W	There once existed a large continent	
				on the planet called Lexendria.	
				There, Mitos and Man shared their	
				vast knowledge and technology,	
				and walked together on the same	
				path towards prosperity.	
					
				However,	
				the humans who had obtained this	
				knowledge and technology misused it.#0E	
0x135e2	0x41	None	#2E#0W	Environmental devastation,	
				overrunning other life forms...	
				And eventually, humans started	
				warring amongst themselves.	
				 	
				The countless battles they waged	
				gradually collapsed the balance of	
				astral power that composes our world,	
				and the core of our planet.#0E	
0x1372c	0x41	None	#2E#0W	Then, on the day the humans started	
				the greatest war in history, the	
				planetary core finally ruptured.	
				A massive explosion occurred, centered	
				around the war-torn continent of	
				Lexendria...	
				The resulting flood caused nearly	
				all the land at the time to sink	
				into the sea.#0E	
0x138a3	0x41	None	#2E#0W	The Mitos, anticipating this outcome,	
				created Terra in hopes of one day	
				recreating the planet.	
				There, they built a great city,	
				naming it after the continent of Lexendria,	
				to shelter the humans...	
					
				However, the end came sooner than	
				expected, and many Mitos and humans	
				met the same fate as the planet.#0E	
0x13a26	0x41	None	#2E#0W	To the few sons of man who survived:	
				I want you to know the sight of the Star Capital,	
				where no one exists anymore. I want you to	
				know this exceedingly empty and sad conclusion.	
				 	
				I want you to know the nature and the life	
				the Mitos have preserved in the stones.	
				I want you to know how we should have	
				cherished what was lost.#0E	
0x13bd5	0x41	None	#2E#0W	And I strongly hope that the same	
				mistakes will never be made again.	
				 	
				As humans are beings able to learn	
				from their mistakes.#0E

0x1600c	0x98	Volans		Thanks to you coming here,	
				Noi, I've come to understand	
				some things about this island.	
0x1607d	0x98	Volans		The truth behind the mysterious phenomena	
				that has happened around this island.	
0x160dc	0x06	Volans		ANI_WAIT	
0x16104	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1612e	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Such as?	
0x16193	0x98	Volans		First of all, the matter of	
				the recent massive downpour	
				of strange rubble...	
0x16204	0x06	Volans		ANI_WAIT3	
0x1622d	0x98	Volans		It is similar to the falling	
				ruins phenomenon that sometimes	
				occurs on this island.	
0x162ac	0x98	Volans		Perhaps they are the	
				very same thing...	
				Isn't that right, Noi?	
0x1631b	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x1633f	0x98	NOI	#6A	...Yes, that's right.	
0x16377	0x98	NOI	#6A	Terra has existed as a moon	
				in the sky for a long time.	
0x163df	0x98	NOI	#6A	I think as it gradually aged,	
				the pieces fell down to this	
				world, the surface, as ruins...	
0x1645f	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x16488	0x98	NOI	#6A	And the same thing happened	
				for the star shards, too.	
0x164db	0x98	NOI	#6A	They were created by the Mitos,	
				who stored them in Terra...	
0x16536	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK	
0x1655d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...The star shards fall	
				along with the ruins.	
0x165a8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	They both have the same cause...	
				It's because Terra was in the sky...?	
0x16617	0x06	Volans		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x16643	0x98	Volans		Hehe, this talk	
				is not over yet.	
0x16696	0x98	Volans		In fact, if you think about it	
				further, there's even more	
				interesting things to discover.	
0x16715	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x1673e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x16764	0x98	NOI	#6A	More interesting things...?	
0x167d2	0x98	Volans		Both the ruins and the star shards	
				fall in a concentrated manner	
				centered around this island.	
0x1684c	0x06	Volans		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x16878	0x98	Volans		But if these phenomena occur because this	
				'other world' is floating in the skies,	
				why does this bias exist?	
0x1690b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x16933	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...That's true...	
0x16965	0x98	ALTO		There has to be some reason why they	
				fall especially around Remnant Island.	
0x16a12	0x06	Volans		ANI_NOD	
0x16a39	0x98	Volans		Hehe, I thought so too.	
0x16a70	0x06	Volans		ANI_WAIT	
0x16a98	0x98	Volans		As an experiment, I tried pouring	
				over the records of past cases	
				of falling ruins...	
0x16afb	0x98	Volans		There was only one condition that	
				would satisfy them all falling	
				on Remnant Island from that moon.	
0x16b7f	0x06	Volans		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x16bab	0x98	Volans		That is, if this world was a sphere.

0x16cc0	0x98	Volans		What do you think, Nayuta?

				still feeling a little unwell.	
0x170fa	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT	
0x17120	0x06	Volans		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x1714c	0x98	Volans		In any case, there is no doubt that the

				in preparing for future fallings.	
0x171ec	0x06	Volans		ANI_WAIT0	
0x17215	0x98	Volans		It seems that my homeland has	
				experienced quite a bit of	
				damage from the falling rubble...	
0x1727b	0x98	Volans		For now anyway, we must	
				do all we are capable of.	
0x172cb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x172f0	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I agree...

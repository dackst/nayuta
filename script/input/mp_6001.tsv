0x1c31	0x40	UNDEF		An ancient-looking script is written here.	mp_6000 0x240f
0x1ca4	0x98	ALTO		This tablet...	mp_6000 0x2482
				There's something
				written here.
0x1cf0	0x98	NOI		Hmm, it does look like some	mp_6000 0x24ce
				kind of ancient text, but...
0x1d3c	0x98	NOI		We don't have time to	mp_6000 0x251a
				read it right now.
				Let's come back later!
0x1d9e	0x98	ALTO		Okay... I guess you're right.	mp_6000 0x257c
0x1dd0	0x98	ALTO		(I might want to take a note	mp_6000 0x25ae
				 of this location, just in case.)
0x1e51	0x40	UNDEF		An ancient-looking script is written here.	mp_6000 0x240f

0x20f9	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Looks like something	mp_6000 0x294b
				is written on this tablet.
0x214d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2175	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Do you think it might say	mp_6000 0x29c7
				anything interesting...?
0x21c1	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x21ea	0x98	NOI	#6A	It looks like they're written	mp_6000 0x2a3c
				in ancient script. I'll read it.
0x223a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Let's see...	mp_0002 0x10ffb

0x2299	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x22bf	0x98	NOI	#6A	...It looks like only	mp_6000 0x2b11
				part of the message
				is written here.
0x231d	0x98	NOI	#6A	To read it properly,	mp_6000 0x2b6f
				I think we'll need the
				other parts as well.
0x237a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x23aa	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x23d4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then for now, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2c26
				what's on this tablet.
0x242f	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's search for the other tablets,	mp_6000 0x2c81
				write them all down, and bring it
				to Dr. Volans for inspection.
0x24b0	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0x24d4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah, sure!	mp_0101 0x956b
0x256b	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hey, another tablet!	mp_6000 0x2dbd
0x25a3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x25cd	0x98	ALTO	#6A	All right, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2e1f
				a copy of what it says.
0x261a	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta wrote down the contents of the tablet.	mp_6000 0x2e6c

0x27c7	0x98	NOI	#6A	Ah... If we combine all of what we've	mp_6000 0x3019
				found so far, it seems like they
				fit together into a single document!
0x284c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2876	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Looks like we've got all	mp_6000 0x30c8
				the information we need.
0x28c5	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's take it straight	mp_6000 0x3117
				to Dr. Volans.
0x295d	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x2983	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hmm... It still doesn't	mp_6000 0x31d5
				look complete.
0x29e3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2a0d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Well, let's continue searching	mp_6000 0x325f
				for the other tablets, then.

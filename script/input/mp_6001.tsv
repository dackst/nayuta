0x1c31	0x40	UNDEF		Something is written in ancient letters.	mp_6000 0x240f
0x1ca4	0x98	ALTO		This tablet...	mp_6000 0x2482
				Some sentence is	
				written on it.	
0x1cf0	0x98	NOI		Hmm, they do look like	mp_6000 0x24ce
				ancient letters, but...	
0x1d3c	0x98	NOI		We don't have time to	mp_6000 0x251a
				read them right now.	
				Let's come check it later!	
0x1d9e	0x98	ALTO		Oh...You're right.	mp_6000 0x257c
0x1dd0	0x98	ALTO		(For now, I should memorize	mp_6000 0x25ae

0x20f9	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It looks like something	mp_6000 0x294b
				is written on this tablet.	
0x214d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x2175	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Maybe something important	mp_6000 0x29c7
				is written here?	
0x21c1	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x21ea	0x98	NOI	#6A	They look like ancient	mp_6000 0x2a3c
				letters. I'll read them.	
0x223a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Let's see...	mp_0002 0x10ffb

0x2299	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x22bf	0x98	NOI	#6A	...It looks like only one	mp_6000 0x2b11
				part of the message

0x231d	0x98	NOI	#6A	To read it properly,	mp_6000 0x2b6f
				I think we need the other

0x237a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Is that so...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0x23aa	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x23d4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then for now, I'll write down	mp_6000 0x2c26
				the letters on this tablet.	
0x242f	0x98	ALTO	#6A	We'll search for the other tablets,	mp_6000 0x2c81
				write them all down, and head

0x24d4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah, got it!	mp_0101 0x956b

0x25a3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x25cd	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Alright, I'll record	mp_6000 0x2e1f

0x284c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2876	0x98	ALTO	#6A	It looks like we've gathered	mp_6000 0x30c8

0x28c5	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Let's take it to Dr. Volans	mp_6000 0x3117

0x295d	0x06	NOI		ANI_THINK	
0x2983	0x98	NOI	#6A	Hmm...	mp_6000 0x31d5

0x29e3	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x2a0d	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, let's search	mp_6000 0x325f

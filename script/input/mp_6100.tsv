0x993	0x98	ALTO		(It's the same mysterious animal as always...

0xa27	0x98	ALTO		W-what is with this strange animal...	
0xa6c	0x98	ALTO		(It's an animal I haven't seen anywhere.

0xb41	0x98	ALTO		(I found it again, but...)

0x146c	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x1494	0x98	Signa		Yes, it's certainly a thing to behold.	
0x14db	0x98	Signa		Before we knew it, it seems

0x15dd	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x1624	0x98	Signa		There's no monsters around...	
				For now, let's end our investigation here.	
0x16a3	0x98	Signa		How about it, Nayuta?	
				Everyone in the village seems fine.	
0x1738	0x98	ALTO		It looks like there's still more above us.	
				Since we're here, let's go where

0x17ac	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x17d1	0x98	ALTO		There might be places we haven't checked,

0x1855	0x06	Signa		ANI_LAUGH	
0x187d	0x98	Signa		Haha, I was thinking the same thing.	
0x18c2	0x98	Signa		Then, watch your footing, and

0x195b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT

0x227c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SIT6	
0x22d0	0x98	Signa	#2W#N	Is it a small...girl?	
0x2319	0x98	Signa	#1W#N	No. Though she is small,	
				she doesn't seem like a child.	
0x238b	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	...She is like a "Fairy" that

0x2542	0x98	ALTO	#0W#6A	I wonder where the heck

0x2868	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What's more, I was interested in	
				it before, that	
				"Shining Thing"...	
0x28cc	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Looking at it closely,	
				it seems to be some kind	
				of machine.	
0x2930	0x98	Signa		Yeah, she's holding it tightly.	
				It must be a very important thing.	
0x299a	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x29e1	0x98	Signa		...Anyway, why is she in a place

0x70d2	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT3	
0x70fa	0x98	Signa	#6A	...I don't know

0x7136	0x98	Signa	#6A	"This side" and "that side," and	
				on top of all that, "Somekinda Gear"...	
				There's too many things I don't know.	
0x71ce	0x98	ALTO		That's true.	
				But I'm interested by the various things...	
0x7242	0x98	ALTO		...They called her Noi

0x7290	0x98	ALTO		For now, let's look

0x72db	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x7303	0x98	Signa	#6A	Right.	
				Let's go to your

0x73c9	0x40	UNDEF		After that, Nayuta and Cygna	
				wrapped Noi in a cloth and...	
0x7423	0x40	UNDEF		Taking care not to show her form to the islanders,	
				headed for Nayuta's house.

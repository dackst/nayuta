0x146c	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x1494	0x98	Signa		Yeah, it's quite a view.	
0x14db	0x98	Signa		Looks like throughout this whole

0x15dd	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT4	
0x1624	0x98	Signa		There's no sign of any more monsters around...	
				I'd say we can end our investigation for now.	
0x16a3	0x98	Signa		How about it, Nayuta? Everyone	
				in the village should be safe.	
0x1738	0x98	ALTO		Looks like there's still some more

0x17ac	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x17d1	0x98	ALTO		There's still some places left that

0x187d	0x98	Signa		Ha, I knew you'd say that.

0x2868	0x98	ALTO	#6A	And I've been wondering

0x28cc	0x98	ALTO	#6A	On closer inspection,

0x2930	0x98	Signa		Yeah, she's grasping it so tightly.	
				It must be very important to her.	
0x299a	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x29e1	0x98	Signa		...Why is she in a place like this

				kind of 'gear'... There's too

0x71ce	0x98	ALTO		That's true. Some of what they	
				said still bothers me...	
0x7242	0x98	ALTO		In any case, we still have	
				to take care of this girl.	
0x7290	0x98	ALTO		...Was it 'Noi'

0x72db	0x06	Signa		ANI_WAIT2	
0x7303	0x98	Signa	#6A	Right. How about we go to	
				your house for now?	
0x73c9	0x40	UNDEF		Afterwards, Nayuta and Cygna gently wrapped	
				Noi in a soft cloth...	
0x7423	0x40	UNDEF		Careful not to reveal her to the islanders,	
				they carried her to Nayuta's house.

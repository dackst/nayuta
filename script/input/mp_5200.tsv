0x2f12	0x98	Zext		Human child──

0x2f6f	0x98	Zext		Long ago..

0x2fd4	0x98	ALTO	#16S#240x#270y	!?	
0x300c	0x98	Zext		Once, <Mythos>

0x3052	0x98	Zext		In those days, we gave out the

0x30c2	0x98	Zext		Furthermore, by manipulating the <Power

0x313c	0x98	Zext	#0W	Those people worshipped us...

				<Mythos> guiding "your world,"	
				isn't it.	
0x3440	0x98	Seram		Well, relations between people	
				and gods were going well.	
0x3498	0x98	Seram		...Until "that time" came.	
0x34db	0x98	Creha		──One day...	
				Humans made "a mistake."	
0x3522	0x98	Creha		The result of that...	
				caused a huge calamity for the world.	
0x357d	0x98	Creha		Civilization and beautiful nature	
				were destroyed too quickly...	
0x35e4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	And the "Calamity" was

0x3631	0x98	ALTO	#6A	And you're saying it was caused	
				by the hands of humans!?	
0x3709	0x98	Zext		Whether you believe it or not,	
				it happened in reality.	
0x37c8	0x98	Zext		...However, we had predicted	
				its degree...	
0x3811	0x98	Zext		Accordingly, the "Plan" that was

				was started.	
0x3882	0x98	NOI	#1W#20x#270y	Pl..an...	
0x38be	0x98	Zext		At that time, a beautiful world to

0x666e	0x98	Zext	#6A	Noi was originally an existence

0x1f26	0x98	Zext		I never thought it possible that a human

0x1f88	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Enough. Where are Creha and Cygna?	
0x200b	0x41	None	#0W#1E#889c	We're here, of course.#0E

0x297a	0x98	Zext		The preparations are finally over.	
0x29c7	0x98	Zext		All there is left to do is charge

0x2b66	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What is it that you...

0x2bb2	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Plunging Terra into crisis...

				Just what are you guys trying to do?	
0x2c7b	0x06	Zext		ANI_SIT2_NOD	
0x2cad	0x98	Zext		...Keheh, very well, then.
				The plan has already	
				entered the final stage...	
0x2ce0	0x98	Zext		There is nothing you could do now to stop it.	
0x2f12	0x98	Zext		Son of man, you know not the	
				true history of your world.	
0x2f6f	0x98	Zext		Long ago, we Mitos... also	
				lived amongst your world.	
0x2fd4	0x98	ALTO	#16S#240x#270y	...!?	
0x300c	0x98	Zext		Mitos once lived in harmony with humans.	
0x3052	0x98	Zext		We shared the vast knowledge	
				and technology we possessed	
				at the time.	
0x30c2	0x98	Zext		Furthermore, by manipulating	
				astral power, we lead the	
				world down a righteous path.	
0x313c	0x98	Zext	#0W	Those humans worshipped	
				us... as a race of "gods."	
0x319c	0x98	ALTO	#0W#240x#270y	A race... of gods...	
0x3240	0x40	ALTO		Then... The mural
				in Heimmel...	
0x33e3	0x98	Seram		Heh, an image of the Mitos	
				leading your world.	
0x3440	0x98	Seram		Well, the relationship between god	
				and man was going pretty well.	
0x3498	0x98	Seram		...Until one day.	
0x34db	0x98	Creha		One day... the humans made a mistake.	
0x3522	0x98	Creha		As a result... the world	
				suffered a huge disaster.	
0x357d	0x98	Creha		The beautiful nature and great	
				civilization that we had built	
				were instantly cut short...	
0x35e4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Could this be the legendary Calamity...!?	
0x3631	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Are you saying it was caused	
				by the hands of humans...!?	
0x3709	0x98	Zext		No matter what you believe,	
				it did actually happen.	
0x37c8	0x98	Zext		...However, we had anticipated	
				this to some extent...	
0x3811	0x98	Zext		We had a plan ready to protect the	
				world in case of imminent destruction.	
0x3882	0x98	NOI	#1W#20x#270y	...Plan...?	
0x38be	0x98	Zext		We created a beautiful new world tailored for the 
				preservation of every plant and animal in existence, 
				so that we could one day reconstruct the old one.	
0x393e	0x98	Zext		And thus, we laid the framework for	
				one day remaking a destroyed world,	
				returning it to its former glory.	
0x3a07	0x98	Zext	#1W	That is the #0WTerra Plan.

0x3e95	0x98	Zext		This tower is for more than just facilitating

0x3f05	0x98	Zext		That is, it is also for gathering	
				the vast measure of astral power	
				necessary to execute the plan.	
0x3f7b	0x98	Zext		Heheh, and now, that task is

0x42db	0x98	Zext		The symbol of the Enforcers of the Plan...

0x4ac8	0x98	ALTO	#6A	What will happen to the

0x4b24	0x98	Zext		It will disappear, of course,

0x4b92	0x06	ALTO		ANI_TENSION_SURPRISE	
0x4bc4	0x98	ALTO	#6A#18S	!!!!	mp_0101b 0x3636
0x4bef	0x98	Zext		The fact that some humans had survived	
				on the destroyed world to begin with	
				was just some kind of fluke.	
0x4c6c	0x98	Zext		It would be no issue if they	
				were to disappear entirely.	
0x4cca	0x98	Zext		Our mission to remake the world...	
				You could call it justice itself.	
0x4d32	0x98	ALTO	#6A	N-No way!!	
0x4d67	0x06	ALTO		ANI_TENSION_STRONG_DENY

0x4ded	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Everyone on Remnant Island...	
				They're in that world, too!	
0x4f5a	0x98	Creha		...We must do whatever it takes

0x4fb3	0x98	Creha		For the sake of all life on Terra...

0x5655	0x98	ALTO		Our world will disappear...	
				Even if it IS justice...	
0x56a6	0x98	ALTO		I will not let these two people

0x5711	0x98	ALTO		So... of course I will stop you!!

0x5d60	0x98	Zext		Heheh... Son of man,

0x5dc1	0x98	Zext		However... What about Noi's?	
0x5e22	0xBC	NOI		Exclamation

0x5fe9	0x98	Zext	#400x#270y	Everything we've discussed so far...

0x605b	0x98	Zext	#400x#270y	Why have you not revealed any

0x60ba	0x98	Zext	#400x#270y	If he understood sooner, he might

0x6256	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Noi said she was designed to be

0x63cd	0x98	Creha		Stop... This is irrelevant to the plan.	
0x6466	0x98	Zext	#6A	Heheh, what's wrong...?	
				It's just a diversion	
				before our task completes.	
0x64e0	0x98	Zext	#6A	Selam, answer me.

0x65bf	0x98	ALTO	#16S	...!?	mp_5200 0x2fd4
0x6629	0x98	Zext	#6A	Heheh... The answer is quite simple.	
0x666e	0x98	Zext	#6A	Noi is an entity originally	
				created by Creha and Cygna...	
0x66ce	0x98	Zext	#6A	In order to achieve the	
				Mitos' mission, she cannot	
				disobey their orders.	
0x6739	0x98	Zext	#6A	That is why she chose		
				not to communicate all	
				she knew to you.	
0x67b8	0x98	Zext	#6A	In other words, Noi used you in order	
				to help contribute to the situation	
				in which we currently find ourselves.	
0x6983	0x98	ALTO	#1W#6A	...No way...	mp_0100b 0xe52

0x6a8c	0x98	Zext	#400x#270y	In fact, you hardly ever gave

0x6af6	0x98	Zext		Remember, son of man.

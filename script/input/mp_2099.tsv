0x1958	0x98	Erislet		The mission of the Mitos...	
				Nemeas may have some idea.	
0x19b1	0x98	Erislet		It could potentially be related to	
				the entire world of Terra itself.	
0x1a0e	0x98	Erislet		...If Zext wasn't lying, that is.	
0x1a7a	0x98	Erislet		We wardens will attempt	
				to control the Power of	
				Stars from the temples.	
0x1aef	0x98	Erislet		I leave taking care of
				Lady Creha to you two!	
0x1b6d	0x98	Erislet		Man, I can't believe	
				this has happened...	
0x1bb3	0x98	Erislet		...I wonder what could have	
				happened to Lady Creha.	
				I've got a bad feeling about this...	
0x1c4f	0x98	Erislet		We wardens will attempt	mp_2099 0x1a7a
				to control the Power of
				Stars from the temples.
0x1cc4	0x98	Erislet		I leave taking care of	mp_2099 0x1aef
				Lady Creha to you two!
0x1d42	0x98	Erislet		If you can recover the last remaining Master	
				Gear from the Origin Continent, then the	
				Astrolabe can be completely restored.	
0x1dd0	0x98	Erislet		Speaking of which, all the Master
				Gears up until now have been just	
				left at the altars.	
0x1e40	0x98	Erislet		Zext... I don't know WHAT	
				he is trying to do, but	
				he's doing it for a reason...
0x1ebe	0x98	NOI		...Yeah...	mp_0004 0x13008
0x1f0f	0x98	Erislet		I've tried a number of things since then, but	
				the temple remains almost completely shut down.	
0x1f7b	0x98	Erislet		I've at least been able to send the bare minimum
				amount of Power of Stars throughout the continent...	
				You must recover the last Master Gear soon.	
0x2065	0x98	Erislet		I understand Lady Creha
				has gone to the human world.	
0x20b6	0x98	Erislet		That's probably a good thing
				for Lady Creha's sake...		
0x2117	0x98	Erislet		Though I'm a little worried about
				the humans attacking her...	
0x217c	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x21ae	0x98	ALTO		Uh, she'll be fine. I already	
				spoke to my sister about her.	
0x2209	0x98	NOI		I-I think so too...	
				I don't think that particular	
				island will be a problem.	
0x2275	0x98	NOI		Not all humans seem	
				to be that violent...	
0x22dd	0x98	Erislet		Hmm, is that so...	
0x2311	0x98	Erislet		Hehe, that's a relief.	
				If Noi says so, then there's	
				probably nothing to worry about.	
0x23ca	0x98	Erislet		But, that's too bad. I was thinking	
				that it was about time I stopped by	
				to see Lady Creha and say hi...	
0x243e	0x98	Erislet		As you can probably imagine,	
				I can't just leave here and	
				go to visit Nayuta's world.	
0x24b1	0x98	ALTO		I-I guess so.	
0x24e0	0x98	NOI		If they found you, then all	
				hell would break loose!	
0x254f	0x98	Erislet		As a warden, I should visit	
				Lady Creha at least once.	
0x259c	0x98	Erislet		I'm sure her memory will return	
				sooner or later... When that time	
				comes, I'll have to come visit her.	
0x263b	0x98	Erislet		I'm saved thanks to you.	
				Sorry for asking you to do	
				this on such short notice.	
0x26b0	0x98	Erislet		I'll be here if you guys	
				need me. Keep up the good	
				work going forward!	
0x2749	0x98	Erislet		I've only heard about	
				Zext secondhandedly.	
0x2791	0x98	Erislet		Apparently, he's Lady Creha's father.	
				But... what the hell happened to him?
0x27f1	0x98	Erislet		...In any case, he's clearly wreaking	
				havoc on this world, so we have no	
				choice but to turn against him.	
0x2851	0x98	Erislet		And more importantly,	
				he hurt my nymphs...	
				I can't allow that!	
0x28e2	0x98	Erislet		It's been too hot lately.	
				From now on, I must work to	
				try to restart the temple.	
0x2948	0x98	Erislet		You guys should be careful if you want to	
				proceed. The Holy Mountain Continent is
				supposed to have pretty difficult terrain.

0x2e6c	0x98	Erislet		Hehe, looks like you guys 	
				were able to find Nemeas'	
				nymph without any problems.	
0x2ec7	0x98	Erislet		The caves around here are	
				so vast that it's easy to	
				get lost in them...	
0x2f32	0x98	Erislet		Anyway, I'm glad you found it.	
				Please give my regards to Nemeas.	
0x2fa6	0x98	Erislet		On the presence of Nemeas' nymph,	
				it was somewhere around Scrying	
				Pool Caves in mid-eastern Rieseweld.	
0x3054	0x98	Erislet		You should search for it with	
				the season set to winter.	
0x30b7	0x98	Erislet		It seemed quite disoriented, so	
				please, hurry and help it out.	
0x31dd	0x98	Erislet		Somewhere in Rieseweld's winter,	
				there's got to be a place suitable	
				for laying Moon Bird eggs.	
0x3267	0x98	Erislet		And with the Astrolabe, you	
				can make the season warmer.	
0x32cb	0x98	Erislet		That way, you can also hatch	
				the Moon Bird eggs right away.	
0x3333	0x98	Erislet		I can't leave this place...	
				I hope you guys manage	
				to save the Moon Birds.

0x46d4	0x98	Erislet		Due to the unstable climate, the	
				Moon Bird population has decreased

0x4faa	0x98	Erislet		First, please find a

0x502f	0x98	Erislet		Moon Birds lay their

0x5d97	0x98	Erislet		The Moon Bird chicks should reach

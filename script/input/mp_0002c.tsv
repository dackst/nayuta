0x3b3	0x98	Aulbath		Although my injuries are still getting

0x5db	0x98	Aulbath		If you are prepared, I am certain	
				you will be able to stand up to Zext.	
0x649	0x98	Aulbath		You should save the young Creha,	
				no matter what it takes.	
0x6b1	0x98	Aulbath		As for that idiot... Please

0x867	0x98	Pyxia		I've started painting pictures	
				of the people of this island.	
0x8c2	0x98	Pyxia		With the current situation	
				being as it is, the contest
				is probably canceled though...	
0x91c	0x98	Pyxia		In any kind of bad situation, the image of everyone	
				standing up and working together through adversity	
				should be encouraging to lots of people.	
0x9c1	0x98	Pyxia		In any kind of bad situation, the image of everyone	mp_0002c 0x91c

0xa3e	0x98	Pyxia		I'll do my best to	
				finish this painting!	
talk_Horolo
0xabb	0x98	Horolo		There are stones that seem usable	
				for statues all over the place...	
0xb1c	0x98	Horolo		Maybe I should make	
				a statue of you guys.	
0xb6c	0x98	Horolo		You all seem to be doing whatever	
				you can in this situation...	
				I get that, you know～?	
0xc11	0x98	Horolo		Maybe I should make	mp_0002c 0xb1c

0xc61	0x98	Horolo		You all seem to be doing whatever	mp_0002c 0xb6c

0x1098	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, it's you, Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x44ae
				You have... That is a
				training book, is it not?
0x10ff	0x98	ALTO		Yes, Cygna gave it to me earlier.	mp_0002 0x4515
0x113c	0x98	ALTO		He said it would be	mp_0002 0x4552
				useful in my training.
0x117d	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, is that so...?	mp_0002 0x4593
0x11e6	0x98	Aulbath		It seems you've been gradually	mp_0002 0x45fc
				collecting all the stamps.
0x123e	0x98	Aulbath		...Yes, if you collect a few more	mp_0002 0x4654
				stamps, you should be able to
				learn a new sword skill.
0x12b7	0x98	ALTO		Huh...? A skill?	mp_0002 0x46cd
0x12e5	0x98	ALTO		Oh, yeah, Cygna used them	mp_0002 0x46fb
				often to slay monsters...
0x133c	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm... When facing formidable	mp_0002 0x4752
				foes, they will prove to be
				very useful techniques.
0x139d	0x98	Aulbath		In time, I plan to teach you	mp_0002 0x47b3

0x13f5	0x98	Aulbath		Be patient, Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x480b
				When the time comes,
				I will teach you.
0x145c	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I'm rather	mp_0002 0x4872

0x1497	0x98	ALTO		Until then, Master!	mp_0002 0x48ad

0x15e1	0x98	Aulbath		The number of stamps in the	mp_0002 0x49f7
				Training Book show how many
				challenges you've accomplished.
0x165e	0x98	Aulbath		...Let's see, if you've done this	mp_0002 0x4a74

0x1bb9	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	mp_0002 0x4fcf
				you will accumulate CHAIN and
				gain various benefits.
0x1c2d	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	mp_0002 0x5043
				With these benefits, you can very
				much turn a fight in your favor.
0x1cc4	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be interrupted	mp_0002 0x50da
				after a certain amount of time. It will
				also be interrupted after taking damage.
0x1d4b	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively, you will need	mp_0002 0x5161
				to cooperate with your allies to keep
				your attacks from being interrupted.
0x1df1	0x98	Aulbath		There are more powerful	mp_0002 0x5207
				benefits of CHAIN.
0x1e38	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or more, the experience	mp_0002 0x524e
				you earn will increase. At 100 or more,
				all sword attacks will be critical hits.
0x1ed4	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	mp_0002 0x52ea
				you will gradually restore your health.
0x1f5a	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate	mp_0002 0x5370
				that much, these benefits can be a
				powerful ally in a tough battle.
0x1fde	0x98	Aulbath		It is a good idea to keep this in mind,	mp_0002 0x53f4
				and to fight actively when possible.
0x206d	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash "Spinning Cut,"	mp_0002 0x5483
				you can hit flying monsters.
0x20ce	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch smaller monsters into	mp_0002 0x54e4
				the air. If you can master it, you can gain
				an advantage in your battles.
0x214e	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible	mp_0002 0x5564
				to launch larger enemies.
				Something to keep in mind.
0x21e5	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x55fb
				more powerful secret technique, "Vacuum Blade."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x22c0	0x98	Aulbath		"Down Thrust" is an attack that uses the	mp_0002 0x56d6
				momentum of a fall to increase its power.
0x232f	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is	mp_0002 0x5745
				that, of all the sword techniques,
				it boasts the highest power.
0x23b4	0x98	Aulbath		Although it can leave a wide opening,	mp_0002 0x57ca
				there are many different ways to use it.
				You can try finding them out on your own.
0x2459	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x586f
				more powerful secret technique, "Meteor Attack."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x2538	0x98	Aulbath		"Kamaitachi" unleashes an	mp_0002 0x594e
				intense stroke of your sword
				with a quick step.
0x25a6	0x98	Aulbath		This technique, infused with sword chi,	mp_0002 0x59bc
				can damage enemies against which sword
				attacks are otherwise ineffective.
0x262d	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, its power lies is in its	mp_0002 0x5a43
				longer reach. It is possible to attack
				from a distance with this technique.
0x26e7	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x5afd
				more powerful secret technique, "Divine Wind."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x27c2	0x98	Aulbath		"Swallow Return" can cut down all	mp_0002 0x5bd8
				surrounding enemies in an instant.
0x282a	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling the enemies	mp_0002 0x5c40
				towards you. This is very powerful in melee.
0x28b6	0x98	Aulbath		It is one of the most difficult sword techniques,	mp_0002 0x5ccc
				but if mastered, it can be a powerful tool.
				Never tire, and keep practicing.
0x298b	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x5da1
				more powerful secret technique, "Fallen Lotus."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x2a69	0x98	Aulbath		There exist two types of swords:	mp_0002 0x5e7f
				One-handed and two-handed swords.
0x2ace	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords have great maneuverability, and	mp_0002 0x5ee4
				are capable of delivering quick, successive attacks.
				Generally, they are considered easier to handle.
0x2b6c	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have higher power,	mp_0002 0x5f82
				and easily knock down enemies. However, they leave a
				larger opening between attacks and are harder to handle.
0x2c3b	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	mp_0002 0x6051
				I cannot say which is superior. Choose a
				sword most comfortable for you to use.
0x2cf6	0x98	Aulbath		Some monsters can cause	mp_0002 0x610c
				various status conditions.
0x2d60	0x98	Aulbath		"Poison" rapidly saps your stamina, and	mp_0002 0x6176
				"paralysis" greatly slows your movement...
0x2def	0x98	Aulbath		"Freezing" can stop your movements,	mp_0002 0x6205
				"confusion" derails your actions.
0x2e5f	0x98	Aulbath		Though all can be reversed with time,	mp_0002 0x6275
				there exists equipment that improves
				resistance and status recovery items.
0x2ee6	0x98	Aulbath		If you are heading to a dangerous	mp_0002 0x62fc
				battle, make sure to be prepared.

talk_Dorado
0x2773	0x98	Dorado		Next time that monsters appear,
				I, Dorado, will take care	
				of them in a flash.	
0x27ee	0x98	Dorado		But I haven't seen any monsters around	
				anywhere lately, so that's why I can	
				say that so confidently, hahaha.	
0x2879	0x98	Dorado		This past year, I've begged Orvus	
				to start training me, too.	
0x28d2	0x98	Dorado		I wasn't useful at all during the	
				strange events last year, so I'm	
				trying to become stronger.	
0x2953	0x98	Dorado		Next time that monsters appear,	mp_0000 0x2773
				I, Dorado, will take care
				of them in a flash.
0x2a20	0x98	Dorado		It sure is peaceful...	
0x2a58	0x98	Dorado		It's hard to believe something so	
				crazy happened only a year ago.
0x2ae8	0x98	Dorado		*yawn*... But it's	
				so peaceful now.	
0x2b2e	0x98	Dorado		The fallen rubble has been cleared out, 	
				and all the building damage has been
				completely repaired...	
0x2b9d	0x98	Dorado		It's hard to believe something so	mp_0000 0x2a58
				crazy happened only a year ago.
0x2c5d	0x98	Dorado		Wha... It's C-COLD!	
0x2c91	0x98	Dorado		This doesn't look like rain...	
				What the hell is this stuff!?	
0x2d25	0x98	Dorado		I can't believe such a beautiful	
				girl would come to Remnant Island	
				to stay over...	
0x2d97	0x98	Dorado		And she's a friend of yours, Nayuta?	
				Why the hell didn't you tell me?	
0x2e20	0x98	ALTO		Are you talking about Creha?	
				Umm, I wasn't really keeping	
				her a secret or anything...	
0x2e8e	0x98	Dorado		Tch, even so...	
				It sucks I'm not	
				your age anymore.	
0x2ee8	0x98	Dorado		If only she were another year or two older,	
				then she'd be in the strike zone...	
0x2f52	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2f84	0x98	ALTO		(Dorado is only 20, but	
				 he's already sounding	
				 like a dirty old man...)	
0x3024	0x98	Dorado		If she were a year or two older,	
				she'd be in the strike zone...
0x3091	0x98	Dorado		Nah, maybe if I make a good	
				impression on her now, then	
				later... Later...	
0x30fd	0x98	ALTO		(Is he serious...?)	
0x3158	0x98	Dorado		For now, I just have to make	
				a good impression on Creha.	
0x31af	0x98	Dorado		Then, a year or two later, I strike...	
				Ah, I see a bright future ahead, man.	
0x3234	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x32b4	0x98	Dorado		Crap, I was so mesmerized	
				that I lost sight of her!	
0x3307	0x98	Dorado		I've gotta find her again somehow...	
				And at least ask for her name...!	
0x339b	0x98	Dorado		She must be the daughter of some	
				noble visiting the island.	
0x3401	0x98	Dorado		...Aah, it's no use.	
				Just thinking about her	
				makes my heart race!	
0x34a7	0x98	Dorado		N-Nayuta!?	
				...I-I-It's an emergency!!	
0x34f0	0x98	ALTO		What's the matter, Dorado?	
				Are there monsters on the	
				island again?	
0x3547	0x98	Dorado		J-Just now... This amazing	
				beauty walked by...	
0x35a2	0x98	Dorado		I only caught a glimpse,	
				but what a stunner... 	
				Was I just daydreaming!?	
0x360f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3641	0x98	ALTO		Um, well...	
				(I knew it, it's	
				 about Creha...)	
0x36b6	0x98	Dorado		Like a pure angel...	
				No, a goddess...!	
				And that peerless beauty...	
0x3717	0x98	Dorado		It looks like that damn Ada	
				pulled her into her shop for	
				some reason... Why...?	
0x37ae	0x98	Dorado		Wah, Eartha collapsed!?	
0x37e9	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	
				I-I'll be there for her soon!!	
0x383b	0x98	Lupus		It's a good thing that Dr. Hydrol	
				is here on the island.	
0x3892	0x98	Lupus		Well, no one would disagree with that	
				right now, especially you, Dorado.
0x3919	0x98	Dorado		W-Wah... The beautiful Eartha...	
0x3961	0x98	Dorado		This can't be. I have to	
				see her immediately!!	
0x3a0e	0x98	Dorado		Ada from the weapon shop	
				is not my type...	
0x3a63	0x98	Dorado		She's cute, but when she starts talking	
				about stuff like weapons, she gets so	
				carried away and won't stop.		
0x3af4	0x98	Dorado		...Whenever I take my spear in for repairs,	
				she's always all, "You're not using it right!"	
				and I get lectured at for half an hour.	
0x3b80	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3bda	0x98	Dorado		If someone comes between Ada and her weapons,	
				even a superior officer would get no mercy.	
0x3c53	0x98	Dorado		I prefer the more the more gentle and	
				ladylike type, like Sasha or Eartha...	
0x3cb2	0x98	Dorado		Huh, Cygna? I just	
				saw him a minute ago.	
0x3cfb	0x98	Dorado		Looked like he was in a hurry.	
				He didn't respond when I called	
				out to him.	
0x3d4e	0x98	Dorado		I wonder what happened...	
0x3dbf	0x98	Dorado		Isn't Sasha from the	
				general store lovely?	
0x3e17	0x98	Dorado		She's still so young, yet she	
				runs the store all by herself.	
				Oh～, how industrious!	
0x3e81	0x98	Dorado		From the air about her, I'd say	
				she's the daughter of some	
				wealthy family somewhere...	
0x3f01	0x98	Dorado		With her true identity kept secret, the	
				sense of mystery is attractive, too.	
0x3f89	0x98	Dorado		I think Sasha from the general store is the	
				daughter of some wealthy family somewhere...	
				She always dodges the question when I ask.	
0x4026	0x98	Dorado		But the sense of mystery from keeping her	
				true identity secret is attractive, too.	
0x40c1	0x98	Dorado		Mmhmm, it seems like it's good	
				to not get any closer for now.	
0x4126	0x98	Dorado		...All right, I'll	
				take up guard here!	
				None shall pass!	
0x4187	0x98	Dorado		So I'll let you handle the	
				monster extermination, Nayuta.	
0x41e8	0x98	ALTO		Come to think of it, I don't	
				think I've never seen you	
				fight before, Dorado...	
0x4243	0x98	Dorado		H-Hey now, don't damage my reputation.	
0x428b	0x98	Dorado		E-Even I...!	
0x42d9	0x98	Dorado		I...I can do it if I have to, right?	
0x4320	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x437a	0x98	Dorado		There's monsters in that	
				fallen ruin for sure...	
0x43cb	0x98	Dorado		I have to protect everyone here, got it?	
0x4413	0x98	Dorado		I can't leave my post here.	
				You guys can handle the	
				monster extermination!	
0x44d6	0x98	Dorado		I-I, uh... It's not like I purposely	
				forgot my lunch because I wanted one	
				made by Eartha or anything...	
0x4550	0x98	Dorado		Really, it's not true!!	
0x459e	0x98	Dorado		I-I, uh... It's not like I purposely	mp_0000 0x44d6
				forgot my lunch because I wanted one
				made by Eartha or anything...
0x4618	0x98	Dorado		Really, it's not true!!	mp_0000 0x4550
0x465c	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah, sure.	
				(He just blurted out his true	
				 intentions all by himself...)	
0x4702	0x98	Dorado		Heya, Nayuta! Have you	
				finished greeting Eartha?	
0x474f	0x98	ALTO		Oh, Dorado. Yeah, I just finished	
				putting away my luggage.	
0x47a3	0x98	ALTO		Ha, anyway, it's been so long	
				since I've seen you. How's the	
				guard duty going?	
0x4824	0x98	Dorado		Well, same as always.	
0x485b	0x98	Dorado		This village is the embodiment of	
				peace itself, so there's almost	
				nothing to do, really.	
0x48cb	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I see. Eartha was	
				the same as always, so	
				it's definitely peaceful.	
0x4937	0x6B	Dorado		Ellipsis	
0x496b	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x499d	0x98	Dorado		Ooh... I envy you so much, man,
				having such a lovely sister.	
0x4a04	0x98	Dorado		What's more, not only is she beautiful,	
				but she's also kind and a great cook.	
0x4a6e	0x98	Dorado		...Nayuta. How would you like	
				to get a new older brother?	
0x4ab9	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4aeb	0x98	ALTO		(His womanizing hasn't changed...	
				 Perhaps that's the true sign of peace.)	
0x4b74	0x98	Dorado		I'm so jealous of you, Nayuta. You're	
				lucky to have such a lovely sister.	
0x4bcf	0x98	Dorado		Ooh, I don't stand a chance.	
				She's out of my league.	
talk_Lupus
0x4cb7	0x98	Lupus		With a sudden flash of light, the fairy	
				Noi fell down onto the Tower Ruins.	
0x4d23	0x98	Lupus		But her memories are gone...?	
0x4d66	0x98	Lupus		Oh, here it comes. Life's not	
				worth living without drama	
				like this, am I right?	
0x4de3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4e0d	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x4e3e	0x98	NOI		I don't want to be this	
				guy's entertainment...	
0x4e8f	0x98	ALTO		Haha, Lupus is always like	
				that. Just let him be.	
0x4f2a	0x98	Lupus		Life's not worth living without	
				drama like this, am I right?	
0x4f95	0x98	Lupus		I'm still not entirely sure what's going	
				on, but you're going to cause all kinds	
				of trouble again, aren't you? ♪
0x5034	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, Noi. You're going to	
				cause all kinds of trouble	
				again, aren't you? ♪
0x50c9	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta. It looks like you've	
				been working pretty hard recently.	
0x5127	0x98	Lupus		Next time, go find something	
				interesting for me, will ya～?	
0x517f	0x98	ALTO		(Um, well... That's a little vague.)	
0x51e8	0x98	Lupus		Nothing interesting has	
				happened lately.	
0x5230	0x98	Lupus		...Now that Cygna, Creha, and	
				Noi are gone, it feels like	
				something's missing...	
0x52af	0x98	Lupus		So this is snow...	
				I've heard rumors...	
0x5302	0x98	Lupus		It's like this freaky phenomenon	
				where cold white powder falls	
				from the sky...	
0x53ae	0x98	Lupus		Oh, I was wondering about Creha...	
				I watch all the people coming to and	
				from the island every day, you see...	
0x542b	0x98	Lupus		When exactly did she come	
				to Nayuta's house?	
0x5477	0x98	ALTO		*gulp*...	
0x54a0	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, well, it's okay.	
				She's cute, even though	
				she's shrouded in mystery.	
0x552d	0x98	Lupus		But somehow, I've been getting the	
				feeling that mysterious things have	
				been happening around you lately.	
0x55a8	0x98	Lupus		Coincidence～? I think not.	
0x561c	0x98	Lupus		Hey Nayuta, did you hear?	
				A super beautiful girl came	
				to the island recently...	
0x568b	0x98	Lupus		According to my investigation,	
				eyewitnesses include my brother	
				Dorado, Mr. Sculp, and Ada.	
0x56f2	0x98	Lupus		...Their reports corroborate the idea...	
				Perhaps I should investigate myself...	
0x5758	0x98	ALTO		(H-Hmm, with the way he is, it's	
				 only a matter of time before	
				 rumors start to spread...)	
0x57e6	0x98	Lupus		Hmmm, I have a feeling this is	
				going to be a pretty good scoop.	
0x5833	0x98	Lupus		I'll have to investigate	
				further for now...	
0x58b2	0x98	Lupus		Say, Nayuta... Just where did	
				you obtain the medicinal herb	
				to cure Eartha's illness?	
0x5923	0x98	Lupus		Does it have to do with the fact that	
				I haven't seen Cygna around lately?	
0x5980	0x98	ALTO		W-Well, umm...	
0x59b0	0x98	Lupus		Haha, it's all good though.	
0x59e8	0x98	Lupus		Even though there's lots of things about this	
				case that pique my interest, it's all good as	
				long as everything worked out fine in the end.	
0x5a73	0x98	Lupus		Anyway, tell me about it when	
				you get the chance. It seems	
				pretty interesting.	
0x5ae5	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah... It's a promise.	
0x5b5f	0x98	Lupus		The source of the medicinal herb that	
				cured Eartha's illness, and why Cygna	
				hasn't been around lately...	
0x5bd4	0x98	Lupus		Even though there's lots of things about this	mp_0000 0x59e8
				case that pique my interest, it's all good as
				long as everything worked out fine in the end.
0x5c5f	0x98	Lupus		Anyway, tell me about it when	mp_0000 0x5a73
				you get the chance. It seems
				pretty interesting.
0x5cf9	0x98	Lupus		Even though there's lots of things about this	mp_0000 0x59e8
				case that pique my interest, it's all good as
				long as everything worked out fine in the end.
0x5d84	0x98	Lupus		Anyway, tell me about it when	mp_0000 0x5a73
				you get the chance. It seems
				pretty interesting.
0x5e2e	0x98	Dorado		Wah, Eartha collapsed!?	mp_0000 0x37ae
0x5e69	0x98	Dorado		This is big trouble...	mp_0000 0x37e9
				I-I'll be there for her soon!!
0x5ebb	0x98	Lupus		It's a good thing that Dr. Hydrol	mp_0000 0x383b
				is here on the island.
0x5f12	0x98	Lupus		Well, no one would disagree with that right	mp_0000 0x3892
				now, especially if you're my brother Dorado.
0x5f99	0x98	Lupus		I'll go see how she's doing later.	
0x5fdc	0x98	Lupus		...Sorry, but I should let	
				my grandpa know first.	
0x6065	0x98	Lupus		There exist some people who	
				claim this world is spherical.		
0x60ce	0x98	Lupus		There sure are some weirdos	
				out there, aren't there?	
0x6123	0x98	Lupus		If the world were round,	
				people on the lower half	
				would fall right off.	
0x6188	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, but... I also think	
				the world is spherical.	
0x61f6	0x98	ALTO		You see, if you look out at the	
				horizon, it's slightly curved...	
0x623a	0x98	ALTO		This fact stays true no matter	
				where you go in the world.	
				Nothing else can explain it...	
0x62c0	0x6B	Lupus		Sweatdrop	
0x62f3	0x98	Lupus		...Oh, okay, okay. Jeez,	
				you don't know what you're	
				talking about sometimes.	
0x6364	0x98	Lupus		Heh... You're a bit of a	
				weirdo yourself, Nayuta.	
0x63c2	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x63f4	0x98	ALTO		(Soundly rejected...)	
0x646b	0x98	Lupus		The curvature of the horizon
				is an optical illusion...	
				That's just common sense.	
0x64f0	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, you don't know	
				what you're talking	
				about sometimes.	
0x6549	0x98	Lupus		Hehe... Well, I always thought	
				you were a bit of a weirdo.	
0x65c9	0x98	Lupus		So the world is round because	
				the horizon is curved, eh?	
0x6623	0x98	Lupus		Heh... You're a bit of a	mp_0000 0x6364
				weirdo yourself, Nayuta.
0x66b9	0x98	Lupus		Nayuta, you guys just now...	
				Did you carry something like	
				a little doll into your house?	
0x6729	0x98	Lupus		Did you find it in the ruins?	
0x6767	0x98	ALTO		Umm, uh...	
				(A doll... He must mean Noi.)	
0x67b9	0x98	ALTO		(We wrapped her in cloth	
				 to hide her just in case,	
				 but someone still saw...)	
0x684a	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x687c	0x98	ALTO		(S-So... How do	
				 I explain this?)	
0x68cb	0x98	Lupus		(...Hmm, if he's not answering, then	
				 they really did find something...)	
0x6935	0x98	Lupus		...Hehe, oh well. You'll show	
				it to me one of these days.	
0x6989	0x98	ALTO		Umm, yeah, one day.	
0x69dc	0x98	Lupus		So there WAS a doll you	
				guys secretly carried	
				home from the ruins...	
0x6a3e	0x98	Lupus		...Hehe, feels like something	
				fun is about to happen.	
0x6acf	0x98	Lupus		Hearing my grandpa's stories, and	
				freaking out my brother Dorado...	
				Those are entertaining enough. 	
0x6b27	0x98	Lupus		But all this stuff happening only the
				morning after you guys come back...	
0x6b85	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, you've certainly lived up to	
				your reputations as troublemakers.	
0x6bec	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6c1e	0x98	ALTO		(That's a heck of an accusation...)	
0x6c87	0x98	Lupus		But it's still a shame. If it were	
				tourist season right now, it would	
				be even more exciting...	
0x6cf2	0x98	Lupus		I could even charge a	
				spectator fee... Hmm...	
0x6d2d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6d95	0x98	Lupus		Yo, Nayuta. You're	
				looking good.	
0x6dcf	0x98	ALTO		You too, Lupus.	
0x6dfe	0x98	ALTO		...I mean, is there a reason	
				why you're smiling at me	
				like that?	
0x6e60	0x98	Lupus		Oh, you really want to know?	
0x6e96	0x98	Lupus		Whatever you say. It's because
				you troublemakers have returned
				to the village.	
0x6f0e	0x98	Lupus		It's about time something interesting	
				happened in this overly peaceful and	
				boring village.	
0x6f93	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6fc5	0x98	ALTO		Troublemakers?	
				Maybe, if we're talking	
				about Cygna, sure.	
0x7018	0x98	Lupus		No, no. Though you may act innocent,	
				you have plenty of inclinations of	
				that nature as well, don't you think?	
0x7097	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, that's why I'm so excited	
				for this summer vacation, anyway.	
0x712d	0x98	Lupus		It's way too peaceful in this village,	
				and more than a little boring.	
0x717f	0x98	Lupus		But now the two troublemakers,	
				Nayuta and Cygna, are back...	
0x71d7	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, that's why I'm so excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for this summer vacation, anyway.
0x7253	0x98	Lupus		It's way too peaceful in this village,	mp_0000 0x712d
				and more than a little boring.
0x72a5	0x98	Lupus		Hehe, that's why I'm so excited	mp_0000 0x7097
				for this summer vacation, anyway.
talk_Aquela
0x7370	0x98	Aquela		Oh my, you...	
0x73a0	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, you have lovely eyes, don't you?	
0x73e6	0x98	Aquela		And so, in my reading of the stars,	
				I can see you are one burdened	
				with a great destiny.
0x744b	0x6B	Aquela		Ellipsis	
0x747f	0x98	ALTO		Uh, and you are...?	
0x74ae	0x98	Aquela		Hehehe... As an astrologer, I	
				take great interest in you.	
0x7507	0x98	Aquela		That is how it seems to me, boy.	
				I want you to keep this.	
0x7558	0xC1	System		obtained.	
0x75d7	0x98	Aquela		I get some very interesting	
				premonitions from you...	
				This is thanks for that.	
0x7692	0x98	Aquela		...Though I didn't plan on
				visiting this island again.	
0x76e9	0x98	Aquela		This presence... It seems that	
				fate has again begun to turn.	
0x7745	0x98	Aquela		Hehe, relax, boy. There's	
				nothing sinister at work.	
0x77bc	0x98	Aquela		It seems that the fate that was severed	
				from this island has again begun to turn.	
0x7828	0x98	Aquela		My astrology did not foresee this.	
				It's possible some major forces are	
				at work here.	
talk_Sculp
0x7935	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta, I've got	
				a question for you.	
0x7988	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	
				What is it?	
0x79cb	0x98	Sculp		I actually heard this	
				from Antlia recently...	
0x7a23	0x98	Sculp		Apparently using fertile soil	
				will greatly improve crop yield.	
0x7a7d	0x98	Sculp		It's supposed to be better than manure,	
				and pretty popular on the continent.	
0x7adf	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	
				I can't find any good soil...	
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?	
0x7b57	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh?	
				I don't think so.	
0x7bb0	0x98	ALTO		To begin with, Remnant Island soil	
				is probably rocky and full of salt...	
0x7c18	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	
				If you say so, it must be true.	
0x7c75	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems like it's		
				nothing but a fantasy for	
				us here, eh? Sorry, my bad.	
0x7cd2	0x98	Sculp		But if you ever do find some	
				good soil somewhere, it'd be	
				great if I could use it.	
0x7d44	0x98	Sculp		Just keep an eye out for it.	
0x7d86	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	
0x7db3	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile soil, huh?	
				 If I find any, Maybe I should	
				 try bringing it to Sculp?)	
0x7f0a	0x98	Sculp		You know, Boote has gotten all	
				fired up about helping with the	
				house for some reason.	
0x7f6a	0x98	Sculp		Maybe that kid who has been nothing	
				but trouble until now is starting	
				to grow up a little.	
0x7fcf	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare chance,	
				I've got to teach him a lesson	
				while we're at it.	
0x8051	0x98	Sculp		You know, Boote has gotten all	mp_0000 0x7f0a
				fired up about helping with the
				house for some reason.
0x80b1	0x98	Sculp		Haha, since it's a rare chance,	mp_0000 0x7fcf
				I've got to teach him a lesson
				while we're at it.
0x8141	0x98	Sculp		Oh, it's Nayuta. Thanks for	
				helping me with milking	
				Jessica the other day.	
0x81b1	0x98	Sculp		If only I could get Boote to	
				help me with this work...	
0x8209	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, he can't help it. Boote's only	
				old enough to be interested in playing.	
0x827e	0x98	ALTO		I'm always here if you need any	
				help, so feel free to ask.	
0x82e3	0x98	Sculp		Haha, I think I'll do that.	
0x8347	0x98	Sculp		I've been trying to teach Boote too,	
				but he's not the least bit interested.	
0x83a9	0x98	Sculp		Good grief, I guess I'll just	
				have to rely on you for the	
				summer months, Nayuta.	
0x8431	0x98	Sculp		I-It's cold...! What's happening!?	
0x8470	0x98	Sculp		This is not good. I have	
				to check on the crops...	
0x84c0	0x98	Sculp		I can't let my babies raised with	
				my own blood, sweat, and tears die!	
0x854f	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta. If you're looking	
				for Creha, she just passed by	
				here a minute ago.	
0x85c3	0x98	Sculp		She said she was going	
				on an errand somewhere.	
0x8611	0x98	ALTO		I see...	
				Thanks, Mr. Sculp!	
0x8674	0x98	Sculp		Are you looking for her?	
0x86ad	0x98	Sculp		In that case, you might	
				want to look over that way.	
				She hasn't come back yet.	
0x8751	0x98	Sculp		I had a very sweet young	
				lady assist me with the	
				harvesting work today.	
0x87ae	0x98	Sculp		She said she was staying	
				at your place, Nayuta...	
				Is that really true?	
0x8814	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, it's kind of a long story,	
				but she's staying over now.	
0x886c	0x98	Sculp		Ha, really?	
0x889f	0x98	Sculp		Man, I was surprised when she	
				approached me out of the blue	
				saying she wants to help, but...	
0x8907	0x98	Sculp		Thanks to her, I was able to	
				do my work much faster today.	
				Haha, she was a big help.	
0x899a	0x98	Sculp		Creha... Was it?	
0x89d9	0x98	Sculp		She's beautiful, graceful,	
				and above all, considerate.	
				Yup, she's a good kid.	
0x8ab4	0x98	Sculp		Canie just left to visit Eartha.	
0x8afa	0x98	Sculp		It will be difficult moving forward...	
				If you ever need any help, you can	
				always rely on us.	
0x8b97	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, we're all looking for	
				a way to cure Eartha together.	
0x8bee	0x98	Sculp		I'm going to go through and see if	
				I can find if any of my vegetables	
				have medicinal properties.	
0x8c9c	0x98	Sculp		I heard Eartha collapsed.	
0x8cda	0x98	Sculp		Canie said she was going to go visit her...	
				Is she still not feeling well?	
0x8d46	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x8d78	0x98	Sculp		...Right...	
				Hopefully she starts	
				feeling better soon.	
0x8ddd	0x98	Sculp		I never would have expected Eartha to collapse...	
				Hopefully she starts feeling better soon.	
0x8e86	0x98	Sculp		We have a small farm on the back side	
				of the island... But the weather has	
				been pretty erratic lately.	
0x8f06	0x98	Sculp		It's been strangely hot and rainy...	
				Thanks to that, the vegetables	
				haven't been growing very well.	
0x8f83	0x98	Sculp		However, rumor has it that Remnant	
				Island isn't the only place where	
				the weather's been acting up.	
0x8fef	0x98	Sculp		All over these islands people have	
				been finding that the weather's	
				just not right this year.	
0x9085	0x98	Sculp		Apparently Remnant Island isn't	
				the only place where the weather's	
				been strange.	
0x90dc	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, it's tough working the fields.	
				You're subject to the whims of the	
				gods in heaven.	
0x9166	0x98	Sculp		Wow, that scared me. I've never	
				seen one that big before.	
0x91c6	0x98	Sculp		...At any rate, I have to check the field	
				later to see if there's any damage.	
0x9260	0x98	Sculp		Oh, Nayuta! You've definitely grown	
				in the short time you were away.	
0x92cc	0x98	Sculp		For a minute there, I thought you	
				were a giant or something.	
0x931e	0x98	ALTO		Haha... You exaggerate too much, Sculp.	
0x9365	0x98	ALTO		It's only been four months	
				since I left.	
0x93ae	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it's not that much of an exaggeration.	
				You can never really tell how tall you're	
				getting during a growth spurt.	
0x944d	0x98	Sculp		Here, Jessica, say	
				hi to Nayuta too.	
0x94b4	0x98	Cow		Moooooooo～...	
0x94e1	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I'm home, Jessica.	
0x9551	0x98	Sculp		Well, you'll be here a while during your	
				summer break, right? You should take	
				it easy and relax while you're here.	
0x9606	0x98	Sculp		Since you'll be here a while,	
				you should take it easy.	
0x965b	0x98	Sculp		Just make sure not to catch a cold	
				during your summer vacation.	
talk_Sculp_add
0x974f	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	
				Isn't that pretty good soil!?	
0x97a3	0x98	Sculp		It's dark, has a soft texture and a fragrant,	
				earthy scent... There's no mistaking it─	
				It's of excellent quality.	
0x9830	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I actually found it somewhere...	
0x987a	0x98	ALTO		Oh right, if you want it,	
				shall I give it to you?	
0x9907	0x98	Sculp		Oh, what a big help!	
0x993c	0x98	Sculp		If I have this, I'll be able to	
				quickly raise vegetables and	
				have more free time than usual.	
0x99b7	0x98	Sculp		...By the way, Sasha from the general	
				store came by and said she wanted to	
				stock my vegetables.	
0x9a31	0x98	Sculp		I was so honored by her request,	
				I thought I would respond in turn.	
0x9aca	0x98	Sculp		Anyway, you've helped me out, Nayuta.	
				Please use this well for me.	
0x9b29	0x98	ALTO		I'm glad you found it useful.	
0x9b66	0x98	ALTO		If you need anything else,	
				don't hesitate to ask.	
0x9bbe	0x98	Sculp		Haha, thank you. Good to know	
				I'm in good hands, Nayuta.	
0x9c4d	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	
				to the general store lineup.	
0x9c9e	0x07	System	#4C	If you give soil to Sculp,	
				the lineup of vegetables for sale at	
				the general store will increase.	
0x9d16	0x07	System	#4C	If you find soil,	
				be sure to bring it here.	
0x9dac	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	
				It looks like you have	
				some good soil again.	
0x9e06	0x98	Sculp		If you don't mind, can you please	
				give it to me? I've got some things
				I want to try on the field again.	
0x9e8c	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, sure.	
				If it's useful to you, Sculp.	
0x9f04	0x98	Sculp		Mmm, this is very fertile, too.	
0x9f44	0x98	Sculp		All right... Time to go try it out.	
0x9f81	0x98	Sculp		There'll be new vegetables for	
				sale as soon as possible.	
0xa012	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d
				to the general store lineup.
0xa09d	0x98	Sculp		Hmm, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x9dac
				It looks like you have
				some good soil again.
0xa0f7	0x98	Sculp		What's more, it's ridiculously high	
				quality... Hmm, just where on	
				Remnant Island did you get his...?	
0xa17c	0x98	ALTO		There's, uh, various places.	
0xa1ba	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, I'm giving	
				this to you, Sculp.	
0xa22e	0x98	Sculp		Thanks as always.	
				You're a great help.	
0xa277	0x98	Sculp		With soil this good,	
				I should be able produce	
				even more vegetables!	
0xa2ef	0x98	Sculp		Haha, for a farmer, there's	
				no better happiness than this.	
0xa355	0x98	Sculp		I should be able to sell these new	
				vegetables to the general store.	
				Nayuta, I'm glad you found this for me.	
0xa416	0x07	System	#3C	New vegetables have been added	mp_0000 0x9c4d

0xa855	0x98	Bootie		Not anymore. I even help	
				around the house.	
0xa899	0x98	Bootie		...Sometimes, anyway.	
0xa8dc	0x98	ALTO		Haha, is that right?	
				You HAVE grown, Boote.	
0xa927	0x98	Bootie		...I knew it, you really

0xa994	0x98	Bootie		I'm already 11. I can

0xa9f3	0x98	Bootie		We don't need a handyman	
				like you for that anymore.	
				Don't forget it, Nayuta!	
0xaa95	0x98	Bootie		Wow, it got cloudy all of	
				a sudden! Is this snow?	
				It's so COLD!!	
0xaae3	0x98	Bootie		...Achoo!!	
0xab0f	0x98	Bootie		Erm... Maybe I should stay home after all...	
0xab85	0x98	Bootie		Even though it's my first time	
				seeing snow, I finally understand...	
0xabe5	0x98	Bootie		That's why they call it a	
				cold when you get sick...
0xac63	0x98	Bootie		Huh, have I seen Cygna?	
0xac9f	0x98	Bootie		...I just saw him earlier, see─.	
				He kind of had a poopy look on his face.	
0xad09	0x98	ALTO		A poopy look...?	
0xad3b	0x98	Bootie		Well, I dunno. It just felt	
				like it would be hard to get	
				him to come play with me.	
0xadac	0x98	Bootie		I think I saw him going to the beach,	
				but I haven't seen him since then.	
0xae0d	0x98	ALTO		Got it... Thanks.	
0xae6c	0x98	Bootie		The general store has some star	
				shards for sale on display.	
0xaed2	0x98	Bootie		They're not like the tiny ones I	
				usually pick up. You can actually	
				see another world with them.	
0xaf4c	0x98	Bootie		...Man, those are nice.	
				I want one...	
0xafd6	0x98	Bootie		D-Dammit... I wanna go, too...	
0xb014	0x98	Bootie		Nayuta, no fair!	
				Take me with you!	
0xb057	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry, Boote.	
				It's still dangerous.	
0xb0a6	0x98	Bootie		Damn it... So arrogant just because

talk_Pyxia
0xb25a	0x98	Pyxia		Hehe, I'm here again in search	
				of a subject for my painting.	
0xb2ad	0x98	Pyxia		In the art contest this year, I'm sure	
				to be the one to take first place.	
0xb30a	0x98	Pyxia		There's no way I won't win, now	
				that I've leveled up as an artist	
				from an "egg" to "chick!"	
0xb3a7	0x98	Pyxia		There's no way I won't win, now	mp_0000 0xb30a
				that I've leveled up as an artist
				from an "egg" to "chick!"
0xb41c	0x98	Pyxia		And this is the year I will finally	
				become a full-fledged chicken!	
0xb46d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xb4d5	0x98	Pyxia		I hear these specialty "star shards"	
				project amazingly beautiful scenery.	
0xb54c	0x98	Pyxia		And there are people who	
				sketch that scenery...	
				...I can't lose to them!	
0xb5bf	0x98	Pyxia		If that's the case, I'll have to paint	
				the landscapes only I could make, using	
				the images inside my head!		
0xb641	0x98	Horolo		Hey, Pyxia, I think that's	
				called abstract art～.	
0xb6cc	0x98	Pyxia		Something like sketching the	
				scenes from star shards...	
				That's a pretty good idea.	
0xb744	0x98	Pyxia		Hehe, I can't lose...	
				Not to an egg-level artist.	
0xb792	0x98	ALTO		(Has an unseen rival	
				 to my sister appeared?)	
0xb81f	0x98	Pyxia		You! Thank you so much!	
0xb859	0x98	Pyxia		With these pigments, I should be	
				able to paint an amazing picture!	
0xb8d3	0x98	Pyxia	#18S	My goal is to be a chicken-level artist!	
0xb941	0x98	Pyxia		This is Remnant Island...	
				Sure is a relaxed place.	
0xb999	0x98	Pyxia		Though it looks like there's lots	
				of interesting things here, too...	
0xb9f3	0x98	Pyxia		I feel like I can get some great	
				inspiration from this place!	
0xba7f	0x98	Pyxia		...Say, why is

0xbabf	0x98	Pyxia		I'm not good with inky	
				situations like this.	
talk_Horolo
0xbb48	0x98	Horolo		So, Pyxia, I made Remnant Island the	
				theme of my painting last year.	
0xbbaf	0x98	Horolo		With that, I won the grand prize	
				in another art contest.	
0xbc13	0x98	Horolo		Hehe, I've never not won	
				the prize in a contest...	
0xbc6d	0x98	Horolo		I've got to work even harder	
				this year, right?	
0xbcb5	0x98	ALTO		(...Did she just casually admit	
				 something amazing just now?)	
0xbd3b	0x98	Horolo		Since Pyxia is working hard,	
				I have to do my best too.	
0xbd96	0x98	Horolo		Hopefully I can find	
				a good motif again.	
0xbe15	0x98	Pyxia		I hear these specialty "star shards"	mp_0000 0xb4d5

0xbf81	0x98	Horolo		Hey Pyxia, I think that's	mp_0000 0xb641
				called abstract art～.
0xc00c	0x98	Horolo		Sketching star shards... Seems like	
				it would pose a challenge different	
				from making a normal painting.
0xc089	0x98	Horolo		I'm a fan of it～, even though I'm	
				an "egg" of a sculptor myself.	
0xc112	0x98	Horolo		Hehe, Pyxia is so happy～.	
0xc155	0x98	Horolo		I want to thank you as well.

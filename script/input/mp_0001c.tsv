talk_Dorado
0xce5	0x98	Dorado		Since that strong monster appeared,	
				I'm concerned another could appear	
				in the future...	
0xd49	0x98	Dorado		I'll have to consult with Orvus	
				and see if we can't do something	
				to protect the village.	
0xdab	0x98	Dorado		Thank you for saving	
				Lyra and Vel for me.	
0xdf9	0x98	Dorado		...But I never thought I'd	
				see a monster that strong...	
				......	
0xe62	0x98	Dorado		W-Well, it's no use	
				getting depressed.	
0xeb5	0x98	Dorado		I'll have to consult with Orvus	
				and see if we can't do something	
				to protect the village.			
0xf3b	0x98	ALTO		Dorado, is it okay for	
				you to be up already?	
0xf8b	0x98	Dorado		Yeah, my injuries	
				weren't very major.	
0xfca	0x98	Dorado		But I was only saved	
				thanks to you and Orvus.	
0x1019	0x98	Dorado		Thank you for saving	mp_0001c 0xdab
				Lyra and Vel for me.
0x10a1	0x40	UNDEF		Dorado seems to have lost consciousness.	mp_0000d 0xfab
0x112a	0x98	Dorado		Come on, Nayuta, cheer up.	
				Cygna will pop back in	
				sooner or later.	
0x118f	0x98	Dorado		...It looks like Cygna's	
				still missing, but...	
0x11e6	0x98	Dorado		With him, there's not that much	
				to worry about. He'll definitely	
				come back sooner or later.	
0x123e	0x98	Dorado		Maybe even Creha will......	
0x1280	0x98	Dorado		A-Anyway, cheer up, okay?	
talk_Ursaminor
0x133d	0x98	Ursaminor		When I heard about the monster,	
				I started to wonder...	
0x139d	0x98	Ursaminor		...Even though there's no way	
				my sister is on this island.
0x13f8	0x98	Ursaminor		But... whenever I hear about something	
				like this, I always come and check.	
				There might be a chance...	
0x149b	0x98	Ursaminor		Sis could be in	
				danger somewhere...	
0x14f0	0x98	Ursaminor		.......	mp_0001 0xc917
0x154a	0x98	Ursaminor		I knew Sis and Cetus would make	
				a good pair of companions. 	
0x15a6	0x98	Ursaminor		I should go help Father.	
0x160f	0x98	Ursaminor		It seems okay to leave this	
				to you and my sister.	
0x1676	0x98	Ursaminor		I should go help Father.	mp_0001c 0x15a6
talk_Bootie
0x16e9	0x98	Bootie		Although that broken moon is awesome,	
				I'm already tired of looking at it.	
0x1756	0x98	Bootie		I wanna go explore the ruins.	
				...If only Dorado would let me enter.	
0x17e3	0x98	Bootie		There are probably tons of star shards
				in that newly-fallen giant gear ruin.	
0x186f	0x98	Bootie		Ehehe, I think I'll sneak in	
				once Dorado isn't around.	
talk_Bell
0x18ff	0x98	Bell		All the adults are busy.	
0x1937	0x98	Bell		...Vel is booored.

0x19aa	0x98	Bell		It'll be time for the festival season	
				soon, but everyone seems so busy.	
0x1a0f	0x98	Bell		I heard there might not be a	
				festival this year. Oooh...	
talk_Lyra
0x1a9b	0x98	Lyra		Another world on the moon...?	
0x1adc	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, you've been fighting	
				in such a faraway place up	
				for so long.	
0x1b46	0x98	Lyra		And now, it's for the sake	
				of Creha and Cygna...	
0x1b85	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, don't worry, trust me.	
0x1bc7	0x98	ALTO		Noi and I will definitely	
				be coming back safe.	
0x1c17	0x98	ALTO		...We'll bring Creha	
				and Cygna home with us.	
				I'm sure of it.	
0x1c72	0x6B	Lyra		Ellipsis	
0x1ca4	0x98	Lyra		(...Nayuta is still Nayuta after all.)

0x1d4d	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x1d77	0x6B	NOI		Question	
0x1da8	0x98	NOI		What's wrong? You're staring	
				at Nayuta so intensely...	
0x1e15	0x98	Lyra		Hehe, it's nothing.	
0x1e5e	0x98	Lyra		...Well, at least try	
				not to get hurt.	
0x1eaf	0x98	Lyra		Once this is all over,
				let's celebrate with a	
				party at my place.	
0x1f11	0x98	ALTO		Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0x1f36	0x98	NOI		Absolutely!	
0x1f9a	0x98	Lyra		Make sure to bring back	
				Cygna and Creha, you two.	
0x1fe8	0x98	Lyra		Once this is all over,	mp_0001c 0x1eaf
				let's celebrate with a
				party at my place.
0x204a	0x98	Lyra		I'll just tell you this:	
				If you miss it, I'll never	
				forgive you, got it?	
0x20ad	0x98	ALTO		Yeah... Got it.	
0x20db	0x98	NOI		Leave it to us!	
0x2131	0x98	Lyra		Once this is all over,	mp_0001c 0x1eaf
				let's celebrate with a

0x2193	0x98	Lyra		I'll just tell you this:	mp_0001c 0x204a

talk_Cetus
0x2295	0x98	Cetus		I have no idea what will	
				become of this world...	
0x2305	0x98	Cetus		Is there no way for the world	
				of Terra and our world to accept	
				each other and live in peace?
0x237f	0x98	Cetus		...When you look at a beautiful sight like	
				that, you can't turn to hate, can you?
0x2404	0x98	Cetus		I hear Terra is trying to wipe us out...	
				I can't be bothered to hate them.	
0x2469	0x98	Cetus		Right now, as Reticul said, we	
				should be focusing on getting	
				through these abnormalities.	
0x24f7	0x98	Cetus		Nayuta, Noi... Dealing with	
				Terra is all up to you.	
0x2579	0x98	Cetus		Another monster could appear	
				around here again. We'll take	
				care of it this time.	
0x25e2	0x98	Cetus		But I didn't know the master	
				swordsman Orvus Alhazen	
				retired to this island...	
0x2646	0x98	Cetus		There's no adventurer who doesn't know his name.	
				He's a fellow who's traveled across the world	
				and the hero of several legendary adventures.	
0x26df	0x98	Cetus		...If we weren't in such dire times, I would	
				want to learn a thing or two from him.	
0x276e	0x98	Cetus		We're going to stay on this island for a while	
				and help with the removal of the debris.	
0x27c9	0x98	Cetus		Leave this one to us, and don't hesitate	
				to go back to Terra. I'll be expecting	
				good news from the both of you!	
talk_Cetus_and_Reticul
0x287d	0x98	Cetus		Reticul, are you sure you don't	
				want to stay home with Uncle?	
0x28da	0x98	Cetus		Even after you were able to make up...	
				I'm sure Ursamina is very worried	
				about you.	
0x2972	0x98	Reticul		It's fine, Cetus.	
				I've certainly cleaned up the	
				whole mess with Papa, but...	
0x29da	0x98	Reticul		I love adventuring and treasure	
				hunting. In the end, that was	
				the real reason I left home.	
0x2a57	0x98	Reticul		Ursamina agreed to this, too...	
				For now, let's think about getting	
				through these abnormalities.	
0x2ae1	0x98	Cetus		...Hehe, you're right.	
				That's certainly true.	
0x2b2f	0x98	Cetus		My goodness, before I knew it,	
				you've grown up too...	
0x2b80	0x6B	Reticul		Unknown	
0x2bb5	0x98	Reticul		Wh-What's up with you,	
				Cetus? Jeez...	
talk_Reticul
0x2cf0	0x98	Reticul		Papa and I talked it over, and we	
				finally made up with each other.	
0x2d52	0x98	Reticul		I told him about my dream of being	
				an adventurer, and he forgave me...	
				Ursamina agreed to let me go, too.	
0x2dca	0x98	Reticul		Now I just wish this world would	
				get back to normal so I can have	
				more fun adventures.	
0x2e6f	0x98	Reticul		Papa and I talked it over, and we	
				finally settled our differences.	
0x2ecd	0x98	Reticul		Now I just wish this world would	mp_0001c 0x2dca
				go back to normal so I can have
				more fun adventures.
0x2f82	0x98	Reticul		Making up with Papa... I guess	
				I should be more pragmatic,	
				for Ursamina's sake.	
0x2ff3	0x98	ALTO		Why did you end up fighting with	
				your father in the first place?	
0x3043	0x98	Reticul		...Well, it's a common tale.	
0x3085	0x98	Reticul		I've always had a passion for adventure and treasure	
				hunting. I loved it, and I wanted to grow up to be	
				an adventurer, like my cousin Cetus.
0x3121	0x98	Reticul		However, Papa would never allow	
				it, saying, "Being an adventurer	
				is not a woman's place."	
0x31a0	0x98	NOI		Is that so...?
0x31cc	0x98	Reticul		Well, the main reason I left was because	
				Papa ate the last fish cake that I had	
				saved in the cupboard without permission.	
0x3244	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x3276	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x32a7	0x98	ALTO		(Th-That's pretty lame...)	
0x32e3	0x98	ALTO		(But maybe fights between parents and	
				 their children all are, I guess.)	
0x3389	0x98	Reticul		What made me run away from home was...	
				I guess it was like, resentment over food.	
0x33e9	0x98	Reticul		I mean, I just kept thinking to	
				myself, why would he do that...?
0x3448	0x98	Reticul		Maybe we should have talked about	
				it more. Plus there was the thing	
				about him being against my dream.
0x34e8	0x98	Reticul		...Suddenly it feels a lot easier after	
				talking about it with you for some reason. 	
0x354e	0x98	Reticul		I'm going to have to take this opportunity	
				to talk things over with Papa after all.

0x1540	0x06	Noi2		ANI_NOD	
0x1565	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...Yeah. Because you

0x15b6	0x98	Noi2	#0W	The errors of the Astrolabe have

0x1a27	0x06	Noi2		ANI_DENY	
0x1a6b	0x98	Noi2	#0W	...No. There is no other way.	
0x1aaf	0x98	Noi2	#0W	For the sakes of Lady Creha and Lord Cygna,	
				the only solution was defeating that idol	
				as quickly as possible.	
0x1b57	0x98	Noi2	#0W	If I had told you earlier,	
				you wouldn't have been able	
				to fight as hard as you did...	
0x1c60	0x98	Noi2	#0W	Hehe, you're smart	
				and kind-hearted...	
0x1cec	0x98	Noi2	#0W	But sometimes, you can

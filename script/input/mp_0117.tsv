0xec4	0x98	Carina		I'm happy Noi has	mp_0117 0xd97

0xf0f	0x98	Carina		It would be nice if you

0xfa5	0x98	Carina		It looks like the coastal seas

0xff9	0x98	Carina		Though Axe said he

0x13e3	0x98	Carina		I can't believe scary things such

				It was unexpected...	
0x145f	0x98	Carina		Though we were able to	
				run and hide...	
0x14a6	0x98	Carina		...I hope Kureha is all right.	
0x150e	0x98	Carina		Thank goodness Collie, Vel

0x155d	0x98	Carina		But, I'm not happy at all.	
				I hope this is the end.	
0x164c	0x98	Carina		Cygna came earlier to ask

0x169e	0x98	Carina		He took our excess and stroked

				"May you be protected."...	
0x1713	0x98	Carina		Nayuta, are you surviving

0x1762	0x98	ALTO		N-No, I don't think

0x17d4	0x98	Carina		Cygna had a scary

0x182b	0x98	Carina		It's your long awaited summer vacation.

0x1b24	0x98	Bell		Big brother, Miss Fairy...

0x1b84	0x98	Bell		You defeated that

0x1c9c	0x98	NOI		T-That's none of your business!	
0x1d14	0x98	Bell		That reminds me big brother.	
				Big sister Lyra didn't

0x1d71	0x98	Bell		It was a special atmosphere.

0x1e80	0x98	NOI		Y-Yeah...	
				If I'm free.	
0x1eea	0x98	Bell		Big sister Kureha...	
				When that scary man came,	
				she encouraged Vel and the others.	
0x1f59	0x98	Bell		And when Collie wouldn't stop	
				crying, she comforted him and	
				he calmed down immediately...	
0x1fd0	0x98	Bell		...Big brother Nayuta...	
				Please help her!	
0x2040	0x98	Bell		Big brother Nayuta...	
				Please help big sister Kureha.	
0x2093	0x98	Bell		Because Vel is cheering for you.

0x21a4	0x98	Bell		In a little while,

0x221c	0x98	Bell		Vel will take care

0x2262	0x98	Bell		Vel is already

0x22d3	0x98	Bell		Big sister Lyra came

0x2369	0x98	baby		Abubu...Babbu.	
0x23bf	0x98	Bell		Big brother Cygna isn't

0x240c	0x98	Bell		Big sister Eartha was cured,	
				and will someday return.	
0x2460	0x98	Bell		Even so,	
				Vel is smiling!	
0x24cd	0x98	Bell		If you need my mom,	
				she just went to your	
				house, big brother.	
0x2528	0x98	Bell		Big sister Eartha...	
				I heard she wasn't feeling well...	
				Is she all right...?	
0x2592	0x98	Bell		I hope she gets better soon.	
0x25ce	0x98	baby		Babu.	
0x261b	0x98	Bell		He's worried about big sister Eartha too...	
				I haven't seen big brother Cygna lately...	
0x2690	0x98	Bell		Though big sister's in trouble,	
				where did he go...	
0x2769	0x98	Bell		I was absolutely sure you	
				wouldn't find it though.	
0x27ba	0x98	Bell		Ehehe, as expected from	
				big brother Nayuta.	
0x2804	0x98	Bell		Vel wants to play with big brother

0x287e	0x98	Bell		You know, Vel hid various

				Vel fell on her bottom.	
0x2a74	0x98	Bell		And I just cleaned too.	
				...Vel's depressed.	
0x2ae6	0x98	Bell		Vel thought she would clean	
				until daddy returns!	
0x2b6b	0x98	Bell		Ah──!	
				It's big brother Nayuta!	
0x2baa	0x98	ALTO		Good day, Vel.

0x2e48	0x98	Bell		Ahem, that's great, isn't it?

0x6310	0x98	ALTO		Has he come home yet...?	mp_0116 0x863c
				Let's go check.
0x636e	0x98	ALTO		Now then, all that's left is Boote...	mp_0116 0x86a9
				...Come to think of it, I haven't

0x63e1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_TONTON_SHUE

0x668f	0x98	Carina		Good day, Nayuta and Noi.	
				Is something wrong?	
0x66dd	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x6707	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Um, actually...	mp_0114 0x7532
0x673e	0x40	UNDEF		Nayuta explained that he was here to pick up the	mp_0114 0x7570
				ancestral offerings on request from the elder.
0x67c2	0x06	Carina		ANI_NOD	
0x67e9	0x98	Carina		Ah, I see. We've already	
				prepared the offerings.	
0x683a	0x06	Carina		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x6866	0x98	Carina		I'll go get them, so

0x6af6	0x98	NOI	#6A	This scent...	
				It's dried fish, isn't it?	
0x6bc7	0x98	Carina		Hehe, I doubt it's a good idea
				to offer fresh fish like that.	
0x6c4f	0x06	Carina		ANI_WAIT2	
0x6c78	0x98	Carina		When the Star Festival is over,	
				we always eat the offerings, so	
				enjoy them when the time comes.	
0x6cf2	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x6d1a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Yes, I'll do that.	mp_0110 0x9557
0x6d4f	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, I can take this, right?	mp_0114 0x7b70
0x6e65	0x98	NOI	#6A	It looks like we have all the	mp_0101 0xa690
				offerings the elder requested now.
0x6ed2	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x6ef7	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, let's get them to the	mp_0101 0xa734
				elder as soon as we can.

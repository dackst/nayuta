0x2917	0x98	Lyra		(At this rate, I'll have	
				 to wait even more before	
				 I can confess...)	
0x2977	0x98	Lyra		(Even though I was	
				 so determined to go	
				 through with it...)	
0x29bb	0x98	Lyra		...*siiiigh*...	
0x29eb	0x98	ALTO		What's up with you, Lyra?	
				That was a big sigh.	
0x2a48	0x98	NOI		Do you feel sick?	
0x2a8e	0x98	Lyra		...Jeez, even if you lost your memory,	
				you're still the same as before.	
0x2aec	0x98	Lyra		I just can't believe you showed	
				up at such a time. You're so dumb,	
				you can't even remember anything!	
0x2b48	0x6B	NOI		Unknown	
0x2b79	0x98	NOI		H-Huh?	
0x2b9e	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, please calm down.	
				I don't understand what	
				you're saying...	
0x2bff	0x98	Lyra		Oh well, forget it.	
				Just get outta here.	
0x2c47	0x98	Lyra		The most important thing for you	
				guys to worry about now is saving	
				Cygna and Creha, right?	
0x2cb3	0x98	ALTO		...Well, all right, I'll	
				leave you alone for now.	
0x2d06	0x98	ALTO		When this is all over, we can sit	
				down together and have a nice chat.	
				You can tell me about today then.	
0x2d98	0x98	Lyra		...O-Okay.	mp_0100 0x12b0b
0x2dfc	0x98	Lyra		Why don't you just leave me	
				alone for the time being?	
0x2e4f	0x98	Lyra		The most important thing for you	mp_0112 0x2c47
				guys to worry about now is saving
				Cygna and Creha, right?
0x2ebb	0x98	Lyra		Once you've done what you need	
				to do, be sure to come back	
				safely, all right!?	
0x2f3f	0x98	Lyra		The most important thing for you	mp_0112 0x2c47
				guys to worry about now is saving
				Cygna and Creha, right?
0x2fab	0x98	Lyra		Once you've done what you need	mp_0112 0x2ebb
				to do, be sure to come back
				safely, all right!?
0x303d	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta, thank you for earlier.	
				...I'm glad that you came for me.	
0x309d	0x98	ALTO		No, it was my fault, too...	
				Sorry for always worrying you.	
0x30f9	0x98	ALTO		...From now on, we will	
				be heading off to where	
				Creha the others are.	
0x314d	0x98	ALTO		I don't want to make you worry again, but...	
				Please, just bear with me a little more.	
0x31ab	0x98	Lyra		...I understand. If you say	
				so, then I won't stop you.	
0x31fd	0x98	Lyra		Noi, take care of	
				Nayuta for me.	
0x323d	0x98	NOI		Leave it all to me!	
0x329b	0x98	Lyra		Be careful out there, you two.	
				I'm worried about you, but I'll	
				wait here for you guys.	
0x3306	0x98	Lyra		Creha and Cygna...	
				Please take care of them.	
0x33ce	0x98	Lyra		Hey, what even is this snow stuff?	
				If you touch it, it turns to water.	
0x342d	0x98	Lyra		Is it like cold rain or something...?	
				Hmm... I dunno, I'm not sure...	
0x34cd	0x98	Lyra		Huh, Creha...?	
0x34f9	0x98	Lyra		Creha begged me to give her an errand earlier.	
				She wouldn't listen to me, and insisted on	
				wanting to help, no matter what.
0x359b	0x98	ALTO		I see... Sorry about that.	
				Do you know where she went?	
0x35e3	0x98	Lyra		Hmm... She went to the elder's place, but...	
				She should have been back by now...	
0x3650	0x98	Lyra		She might have stopped somewhere along the way.	
				...It's been bothering me for a while now, too.	
0x36c8	0x98	ALTO		Well, I'll try looking for her.	
				Don't worry about it, Lyra.	
0x372e	0x98	Lyra		Huh!? O-Okay...	
0x3797	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have given	
				her that errand, what if...	
0x37ff	0x98	Lyra		Now I'm so worried about it,	
				I can't get my work done!	
0x3855	0x98	ALTO		Haha...	
				(Even though Lyra can be harsh,	
				 she's actually kind at heart.)	
0x38e4	0x98	Lyra		Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have given	mp_0112 0x3797
				her that errand, what if...
0x394c	0x98	Lyra		Just where the hell did she	
				 wander off to, I wonder...?	
0x39d5	0x98	Lyra		Welcooome...	
0x3a01	0x98	Lyra		(...Just now, I think I saw that	
				 girl in front of the shop...	
				 Maybe it was my imagination...)	
0x3a82	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, you know, you don't look	
				too good. Is something wrong?	
0x3ad2	0x98	Lyra		Whose fault do you think that is!?	mp_0110 0x2813e
0x3b14	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x3b46	0x98	ALTO		(Huh...? I-Is it my fault!?)	
0x3bb9	0x98	Lyra		This isn't good, this isn't good.	
				That girl can't be coming here...	
				It must be a hallucination.	
0x3c34	0x98	Lyra		Oh yeah... I think I was asked	
				to go to Carina's place and	
				look after Cory today.	
0x3cbe	0x98	Lyra		I should get going. It'll	
				be a nice change of pace.	
0x3d47	0x98	Lyra		*sigh*...	
0x3d72	0x98	Lyra		It can't be...	
				With someone like that...	
0x3db6	0x98	Lyra		...No, it hasn't been	
				decided quite yet...	
0x3e0d	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x3e3f	0x98	ALTO		(Lyra, what's going on...?)	
0x3e9f	0x98	Lyra		...*siiiigh*...	
				Her skin is so pretty,	
				and she's so beautiful...	
0x3efc	0x98	Lyra		...No, but I still have a chance...	
0x3f79	0x98	Lyra		Oh, Nayuta. Cygna's	
				not with you?	
0x3fb9	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yeah. He had something else to do.	
0x4005	0x98	ALTO		.....	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0x4037	0x98	Lyra		Nayuta... You look	
				kind of down.	
0x407d	0x98	Lyra		Are you and Cygna	
				having a fight?	
0x40c7	0x98	ALTO		...I'm not quite sure.	
				Even I don't understand	
				exactly what happened.	
0x412c	0x98	ALTO		(Cygna... Why in the world	
				 are you doing this...)	
0x417d	0x6B	Lyra		Unknown	
0x41af	0x98	Lyra		Jeez, you guys. I don't know what	
				to do with you two anymore.	
0x41fa	0x98	Lyra		You know, there's still at least a three year	
				age difference between you, so it's only natural	
				that there would be gaps in understanding.	
0x42ab	0x98	Lyra		Anyway, all you can do is try to communicate	
				and be honest to each other about things.	
0x430c	0x6B	ALTO		Ellipsis	
0x433e	0x6B	Lyra		Question	
0x4370	0x98	Lyra		Wh-What? You got quiet	
				all of a sudden...	
0x43b7	0x98	ALTO		...Ahaha, it's nothing.	
				I was thinking that it's	
				just like you to say that.
0x441f	0x98	ALTO		Thank you. You've made me	
				feel a little better.	
0x4477	0x98	Lyra		Wh-What are you saying?	
				...Weirdo Nayuta.	
0x44fe	0x98	Lyra		I don't know what's up between you, but...	
				It's good that you're close with Cygna.	
0x4565	0x98	Lyra		I've gotta go to Eartha for	
				a cooking lesson after this.	
0x45bd	0x98	Lyra		I don't have time to deal with	
				you guys 24 hours a day, okay?	
0x4643	0x98	Lyra		Anyway, if you're fighting with	
				Cygna, you should make up as	
				soon as possible.	
0x46a5	0x98	Lyra		If you guys weren't together,	
				you wouldn't be you. Jeez...	
0x4734	0x98	Lyra		Hm, looks like nothing's broken.	
				...Good, good.	
0x478a	0x98	ALTO		Lyra, you're helping	
				out at the bar?	
0x480e	0x98	Lyra		Ah, yeah... With the fall of such	
				a large ruin, there's lots of stuff	
				that needs to be done.	
0x487c	0x98	Lyra		Hey, Nayuta... Are you	
				really feeling that	
				excited about this?	
0x48ce	0x98	ALTO		Eh? You can tell?	
0x48f9	0x98	Lyra		Well, I can see through you that much	
				at least. I've known you since you	
				were a toddler, after all.	
0x497a	0x98	Lyra		You're just going to go	
				check out the new ruins	
				again, aren't you?	
0x49d4	0x98	Lyra		Good grief, you haven't	
				changed at all...	
0x4a1c	0x98	Lyra		...No, maybe you have. It seems that since	
				Cygna came to the island, you haven't been	
				spending as much time with me...	
0x4aa3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4ad5	0x98	ALTO		Umm, Lyra? I think you're	
				getting off track...	
0x4b23	0x98	Lyra		...A-Anyway, understand?	
				Don't go anywhere too	
				dangerous, all right?	
0x4b7e	0x98	Lyra		If you get injured or	
				something, you deserve it!	
0x4bd0	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha... I get it. I can't	
				go against you, Lyra.	
0x4c66	0x98	Lyra		I get the feeling that you're	
				going to do something dangerous	
				again, Nayuta...	
0x4cc9	0x98	Lyra		Understand? Don't go anywhere	
				too dangerous, all right?	
0x4d18	0x98	Lyra		If you get injured or	mp_0112 0x4b7e
				something, you deserve it!
0x4d93	0x98	Lyra		I can see through you, Nayuta.
0x4df8	0x98	Lyra		If you get injured or	mp_0112 0x4b7e
				something, you deserve it!
talk_Lyra_and_Creha
0x4eb7	0x98	Lyra		You see that bottle on the shelf?	
				We've been keeping that for one	
				of the customers...	
0x4f1f	0x98	Creha		...This one? It's	
				still pretty full.	
0x4f68	0x98	Lyra		N-No! That's 20-year-old	
				vintage wine...	
				Please don't drop it!	
talk_Barton
0x5064	0x98	Barton		Hmm, by the looks of it, she	
				missed the timing after all...	
0x50ba	0x98	Barton		Hehe, my daughter's bad timing	
				is a hard thing to break.	
0x5155	0x98	Lyra		Oh jeez, shut up, Dad!	
0x51e0	0x98	Barton		Hehe, my daughter's bad timing	mp_0112 0x50ba
				is a hard thing to break.
0x523d	0x98	Barton		Well, I hope you'll continue	
				to be good friends with her.	
0x52c0	0x98	Barton		Hey, Nayuta. I heard you	
				were supposed to spend	
				time with Lyra today.	
0x5320	0x98	Barton		I'm sorry, I'm sure you must	
				be already very busy with	
				your Handyman Shop work.	
0x5371	0x98	ALTO		Haha, it's all right.	
				We're just having a 	
				quick word before work.	
0x53d0	0x98	ALTO		I'm sorry I haven't had time	
				since I returned until now.	
0x543d	0x98	Barton		Haha, is that right?	
				Lyra would be happy	
				to hear that.	
0x549a	0x98	Barton		Well, hopefully you'll be able	
				to reciprocate her feelings...	
0x550e	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x5540	0x98	Barton		Whoops, nevermind.	
				Well, enjoy your time 	
				together today.	
0x55cb	0x98	Barton		Hehe, I can't help but feel	
				a little protective, can I?	
0x561c	0x98	Barton		Well, please don't mind me.	
				Please take care of Lyra.	
0x56af	0x98	Barton		People, myself included, have	
				been blessed with many gifts	
				from the sea and nature.	
0x5711	0x98	Barton		And until now, never	
				once thought to give	
				anything back.	
0x575e	0x98	Barton		Considering that, perhaps the	
				abnormalities occurring on this	
				sea are... our just deserts.	
0x57e1	0x98	Barton		Even so, I want to protect my	
				precious family and friends.	
				...That is my heartfelt wish.	
0x5886	0x98	Barton		The abnormalities occurring on	
				this sea may be humanity's	
				just deserts..	
0x58f2	0x98	Barton		Even so, I want to protect my	mp_0112 0x57e1
				precious family and friends.
				...That is my heartfelt wish.
0x59a6	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, Noi...	
				I heard you saved Lyra.	
0x59fc	0x98	Barton		Thank you, truly...	
				You just keep helping us out, eh?	
0x5a51	0x98	ALTO		No, I'm the one who's always	
				constantly worrying Lyra.	
0x5aa1	0x98	ALTO		Also... Because of what happened,	
				I've finally made up my mind.	
0x5af9	0x98	ALTO		I should be thanking	
				Lyra for this.	
0x5b33	0x98	NOI		Nayuta...	mp_0000d 0x7671
0x5b5b	0x98	Barton		Is that so...?	
				I'm glad to hear	
				you say that.	
0x5ba4	0x98	Barton		Hehe, please take care	
				of her from now on.	
0x5c29	0x98	Barton		I told Lyra to take the day off, but...	
				Looks like that girl has a mind of her own.	
0x5c97	0x98	Barton		Anyway, please continue	
				watching out for her.	
0x5ce5	0x98	Barton		And please, come back	
				and stay safe.	
0x5d52	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, Noi...	
				We're all rooting for you.	
0x5da3	0x98	Barton		Please, return safely.	
0x5e1a	0x98	Barton		Nayuta... You're finally awake.	
				Oh, thank goodness...	
0x5e75	0x98	Barton		Lyra was really concerned about you, too.	
				She will be delighted to see you're up.	
0x5ec2	0x98	ALTO		Thanks... Where is Lyra now?	
0x5f0b	0x98	Barton		She just left.	
				She should be back soon.	
0x5f53	0x98	Barton		...Don't push yourself too hard.	
				You're bound to be feeling tired.
0x5f9b	0x98	ALTO		Yeah... I understand.	
0x6025	0x98	Barton		You're Noi, right?	
0x605f	0x98	Barton		You seemed to be banged up, too..	
				But please, look after Nayuta.	
0x60bc	0x98	NOI		Y-Yeah, I will.	
0x6112	0x98	Barton		Lyra should be back soon.	
0x614b	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, take it easy, all right?	
				You're bound to be feeling tired.
0x61ce	0x98	Barton		Apparently Lyra left	
				for the cape.	
0x620e	0x98	Barton		She seemed to be getting along	
				quite well with that Creha girl.	
0x625b	0x98	Barton		...Nayuta, if you don't mind,	
				please look after her.	
0x62e3	0x98	Barton		Come to think of it, I saw you
				two talking about something with	
				the elder in the plaza earlier.	
0x6353	0x98	Barton		...No, I won't be so crass as	
				to interrogate you about it.	
				You must be shocked, too.	
0x63d1	0x98	Barton		I thought everyone was making a bunch	
				of noise outside, and it turns out	
				something called "snow" is falling.	
0x6441	0x98	Barton		Sure, I had heard of it from	
				around the time Orvus first	
				arrived at the island, but...	
0x64a9	0x98	Barton		Supposedly it's a seasonal phenomenon	
				often found in the northern parts of	
				the sea and the continent...	
0x654d	0x98	Barton		A young lady by the name of Creha	
				came to introduce herself just now.	
0x6599	0x98	Barton		She was a charming girl, very	
				out of place in a backwoods	
				inn like this...	
0x65fc	0x98	Barton		Heh, I finally understand why	
				Lyra has been so depressed.	
0x6682	0x98	Barton		If you want to know more about	
				this young lady Creha, you	
				should try asking Lyra.	
0x66c9	0x98	Barton		She seems to be getting along	
				quite well with her. Creha
				asked to do some work for her.	
0x6742	0x98	Barton		Lyra should be out.	
				She was asked to look	
				after Carina's baby.	
0x679b	0x98	Barton		She should be walking around the village...	
				I don't know her exact location.	
0x683c	0x98	Barton		(Hmm, Lyra is acting strange...	
				 I think something's up, Nayuta.)	
0x68a7	0x98	ALTO		(Umm, why are we whispering	
				 like this?)	
0x68ee	0x98	Barton		(Hehe, that's because	
				 I'm her father.)	
0x6934	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x6966	0x98	ALTO		(Sometimes I just don't	
				 get old man Barton...)	
0x69dc	0x98	Barton		(Hmm, Lyra is acting strange...	mp_0112 0x683c
				 I think something's up, Nayuta.)
0x6a47	0x98	Barton		(Hehe, I'll offer you my	
				 support from the shadows.)	
0x6ac3	0x98	Barton		Everyone is delighted that	
				Eartha was saved, as if
				she were one of their own.	
0x6b1e	0x98	Barton		Well, perhaps myself included.	
0x6b59	0x98	Barton		I've been a longtime friend of	
				the Herschel family, too. It's	
				a deeply moving time for me.	
0x6bc3	0x98	Barton		By the way... What is	
				Lyra getting up to at	
				a time like this?	
0x6c22	0x98	Barton		She seemed strangely depressed after	
				coming back in a panic earlier...	
0x6cb0	0x98	Barton		All the people of this island share	
				in the pain and joy of each other.
0x6d18	0x98	Barton		It's as though the island	
				has its own heart. I'm	
				proud to be a part of it.	
0x6d98	0x98	Barton		I hear that Eartha has fallen ill...
				Hmm, I'm worried about her...	
0x6df3	0x98	Barton		Lyra couldn't sit still anymore and	
				went to help. I feel the same way.	
0x6e5e	0x98	Barton		I can handle the business affairs on	
				my own. Nayuta, if you need anything,	
				please ask Lyra for help.	
0x6f0d	0x98	Barton		Lyra went over there to	
				help for a while, too.	
0x6f5a	0x98	Barton		I can handle the business here	
				on my own. I hope Lyra will be	
				able to provide some assistance.	
0x7006	0x98	Barton		Ax and Sculp often	
				come here for drinks.	
0x704f	0x98	Barton		Heh, I heard they're childhood friends.
				They have a lot of stories to tell.
0x70af	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, maybe you will come here	
				for a drink with Cygna someday.	
0x7108	0x98	Barton		Whoops, perhaps Lyra would	
				rather have you be on this	
				side of the counter...	
0x7170	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x71a2	0x98	ALTO		Umm, what does that mean...?	
0x71e3	0x98	Barton		...Hehe, nevermind.	
				Please, don't mind me.	
0x7263	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, maybe you will come here	mp_0112 0x70af
				for a drink with Cygna someday.
0x72bc	0x98	Barton		Perhaps Lyra would rather	
				have you be on this side	
				of the counter...	
0x731c	0x98	Barton		Hehe, personally, I'm	
				looking forward to it.	
0x7391	0x98	Barton		Nayuta, maybe you will come here	mp_0112 0x70af
				for a drink with Cygna someday.
0x73ea	0x98	Barton		I hope you treasure your friends.	
				They can last a lifetime, you know.	
0x747d	0x98	Barton		Remnant Island is almost in the center	
				of the Ciencia Sea, so you can't call	
				it easy to access by anyone's standards.	
0x7510	0x98	Barton		The only ferry takes over 12 hours each way... 	
				Well, the rural environment is a nice place.	
0x7584	0x98	Barton		However, the air is always so clear that	
				you can easily see shooting stars.	
0x75fb	0x98	Barton		Some people visit here just for that...	
				We get astronomers like your dad, too.	
0x765b	0x98	ALTO		I remember he used to	
				drink with you quite a	
				bit, old man Barton.	
0x76b4	0x98	ALTO		I was little, so I don't	
				remember that much, but...	
0x7703	0x98	Barton		Haha, he and I would get along great.	
0x7744	0x98	Barton		We used to drink together while	
				gazing at the night sky.
0x77c3	0x98	Barton		Remnant Island is known to	
				tourists as an island where	
				ruins fall from the sky...	
0x783d	0x98	Barton		There's also the beauty	
				of being able to see the	
				stars very clearly.
0x7897	0x98	Barton		Astronomers like your dad	
				were enchanted by this place.	
0x7925	0x98	Barton		Phew, that was close.	
				This bottle almost fell.	
0x797b	0x98	ALTO		Old man Barton...	
				Are you all right?	
0x79be	0x98	Barton		Yeah, I was able to catch it	
				before it fell on the floor.	
0x7a18	0x98	Barton		I was surprised at	
				how sudden it was.	
0x7a5e	0x98	ALTO		(Haha... Old man Barton	
				 is unfazed in any	
				 situation, huh?)	
0x7aea	0x98	Barton		But that was a hell of a quake...	
				I'll have to go upstairs and check the	
				condition of the second floor later.	
0x7b65	0x98	Barton		Anyway, I'm just glad none	
				of our guests were hurt.	
0x7c03	0x98	Barton		Oh... If it isn't Nayuta!	
				Haha, you're back, eh?	
0x7c57	0x98	ALTO		Yes, just now. Good to	
				see you, old man.	
0x7c9f	0x98	ALTO		How's your bar doing?	
0x7cd6	0x98	Barton		Haha, nothing ever happens	
				in a rural inn like this.	
				Nothing has changed.	
0x7d45	0x98	Barton		On days when the ferry comes in,	
				we might get a few tourists, but	
				that's about it.	
0x7da9	0x98	ALTO		Haha, seems like everything's the same.	
0x7ded	0x98	ALTO		Oh, but what about Lyra...?	
				It doesn't look like she's	
				here at the bar today.	
0x7e51	0x98	Barton		Actually, I just asked her	
				to run an errand for me.	
0x7ea8	0x98	Barton		Guess she'll be back before	
				too long, I suppose...	
0x7ef8	0x98	Barton		Well, sorry to keep you waiting,	
				Nayuta. I'll let you know if	
				she returns.	
0x7f62	0x98	ALTO		Understood. Thanks.	
0x7f95	0x98	ALTO		(Lyra...	
				 I hope she's well.)	
0x800b	0x98	Barton		You guys have played with	
				Lyra since you were kids.	
0x805a	0x98	Barton		Now that you're back, she'll	
				surely be happy to see you.	
0x80aa	0x98	Barton		When she returns from her	
				errands, I'll let you know	
				right away.	
0x812f	0x98	Barton		Now that you guys are back, she'll	
				surely be happy to see you.	
0x817f	0x98	Barton		When she returns from her	mp_0112 0x80aa
				errands, I'll let you know
				right away.
talk_Gruz
0x8224	0x98	Gruz		Gwahaha, Noi, my girl,	
				good to see you back!
0x8276	0x98	Gruz		We ought to celebrate with a big	
				welcome party during the upcoming	
				Star Festival as well.	
0x82d5	0x98	Gruz		I'll cook a huge feast for	
				you, you can count on it!	
0x835e	0x98	Gruz		Noi, my girl, good	
				to see you back!	
0x83a8	0x98	Gruz		We should throw a big welcome	
				party at the next Star Festival.	
				You can count on it!		
0x844f	0x98	Gruz		Since yesterday, Lyra has	
				been acting strangely.	
0x849d	0x98	Gruz		She's been mumbling to herself,	
				smacking her head, and blushing	
				at her thoughts...	
0x8531	0x98	Gruz		...Well, she is a girl at	
				that age, you know. Something	
				might be troubling her.	
0x85a0	0x98	Gruz		If you call yourself a man, you'd	
				better make sure to listen to her	
				carefully, Nayu, my boy.	
0x8629	0x98	Gruz		...Well, she is a girl of a certain	mp_0112 0x8531
				age, you know. Something might be
				troubling her.
0x8698	0x98	Gruz		If you call yourself a man, you'd	mp_0112 0x85a0
				better make sure to listen to her
				carefully, Nayu, my boy.
0x872f	0x98	Gruz		Going hungry goes a long way...	
				You know, there's an old saying:	
0x87a5	0x98	Gruz		The most important thing for	
				getting over a huge barrier	
				is your physical health.	
0x8806	0x98	Gruz		Anyway, just eat plenty of food,	
				and build up your strength, and	
				you can handle anything!	
0x88a9	0x98	Gruz		Going hungry goes a long way...	mp_0112 0x872f
				You know, there's an old saying:
0x891f	0x98	Gruz		Anyway, just eat plenty of food,	mp_0112 0x8806
				and build up your strength, and
				you can handle anything!
0x89d6	0x98	Gruz		Gwahaha, developing my new dish this	
				time went better than expected.	
0x8a32	0x98	Gruz		I'll be sure to count on you two the	
				next time I come up with a new dish!
0x8af7	0x98	Gruz		The abnormal weather conditions	
				have made it difficult to stock	
				up on food lately.	
0x8b73	0x98	Gruz		The village's harvest has been sluggish,	
				and the repertoire of dishes available	
				to make is getting smaller and smaller.	
0x8bf4	0x98	Gruz		Mmm, this is not a good situation. It's	
				for times like these that I want to serve	
				everyone a dish that revitalizes us all.
0x8cbc	0x98	Gruz		It's for times like these that	
				I want to serve everyone a	
				dish that revitalizes us all.
0x8d39	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, if only we had the	
				right ingredients...	
0x8dfb	0x98	Gruz		Fairy... No, Noi, my girl.	
0x8e46	0x98	Gruz		You don't seem to be a bad person at all.	
				You gotta relax and come in more often.	
0x8eac	0x98	Gruz		Please feel free to come back	
				here whenever you feel like it.	
				I'll have a nice treat for you.	
0x8f40	0x98	Gruz		Anytime you're	
				hungry, that is.	
0x8f7f	0x98	Gruz		Noi, my girl, please feel free to come	
				back here whenever you feel like it.	
				I'll have a nice treat ready for you.	
0x9023	0x98	Gruz		It's outrageous that they	
				would take a girl like that.	
0x9072	0x98	Gruz		But if you had asked us for help	
				protecting her, I'd have stayed	
				silent and slinked away...	
0x90de	0x98	Gruz		Man, I'm so pathetic...	
0x913a	0x98	Gruz		Why didn't I take a swing	
				at that bastard...	
0x9190	0x98	Gruz		Man, I'm so pathetic...	mp_0112 0x90de
0x91e0	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, my hands are full with	
				finishing up a dish right now...	
0x923b	0x98	Gruz		...The strange powder everywhere?	
				Can you wait a bit longer?	
0x92c2	0x98	Gruz		A silver-haired young lady	
				came in while I was making	
				my new therapeutic dish.	
0x932a	0x98	Gruz		When I tried offering her	
				a sample, she ate some and	
				said it was delicious.	
0x9390	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, it seems this dish is	
				approaching perfection!	
				Gwahahaha...	
0x93de	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9410	0x98	ALTO		(It's amazing that you could	
				 enjoy eating Gruz's new	
				 dishes, Creha...)	
0x949c	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, thanks to that young lady, this	
				new dish is approaching perfection!	
0x94ea	0x98	Gruz		Gwahaha, I guess I'll need to	
				get her to help me with the	
				taste tasting from now on!
0x959a	0x98	Gruz		Now, I've got to think of a plan	
				that will let islanders recover	
				from any kind of illness.	
0x9612	0x98	Gruz		Best would be dishes that you would eat	
				every day to provide proper nutrition	
				and boost your immune system.	
0x966d	0x98	Gruz		...All right, time to come up	
				with a new therapeutic dish!	
0x96e3	0x98	Gruz		All right, now that it's decided,	
				I've got to get to work on 	
				developing my new dish.	
0x975b	0x98	Gruz		Just you wait, I'll come up	
				with a dish that will blow	
				away any illness!	
0x97cc	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9834	0x98	Gruz		Eartha... I can't believe	
				she collapsed.	
0x987b	0x98	Gruz		It has seemed like she's been feeling	
				kind of down for a while now, but... 	
				I never realized.	
0x98eb	0x98	Gruz		If only I had figured it out sooner, I could've	
				helped provide her the proper nutrition...	
				Ooh, I'm such a disappointment.	
0x9981	0x98	Gruz		Eartha... It has seemed like	
				she's been feeling kind of	
				down for a while now, but... 	
0x99e9	0x98	Gruz		If only I had figured it out sooner, I could've	
				helped provide her the proper nutrition...	
0x9a7a	0x98	Gruz		But still, I'm impressed with	
				the work Eartha's done.	
0x9ab9	0x98	Gruz		She's taken up your mother's work at	
				star shard observation for a while	
				now, with great skill for her age.	
0x9b2c	0x98	Gruz		I'm sure she learned from your mother's	
				example, but it's not an easy job.
0x9ba5	0x98	Gruz		She has a reputation for having a skilled	
				hand. You must be proud, Nayuta.	
0x9c06	0x98	ALTO		Ahahaha...	
0x9c5a	0x98	Gruz		Eartha helps out here from time to time.	
				You guys are like family to me.	
0x9cbc	0x98	Gruz		She is beautiful, and a hard worker.	
				Gwahaha... I'm proud of her too.	
0x9d4c	0x98	Gruz		I used to be the head chef of a high	
				class restaurant in San Ceriz.	
0x9daf	0x98	Gruz		I've been a cook for 40 years...	
				You could say I've spent my whole	
				life pursuing cooking.	
0x9e33	0x98	Gruz		There's no way that the food I	
				make won't be delicious!	
				Wouldn't you agree Nayu, my boy?	
0x9eb0	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x9ee2	0x98	ALTO		Well, um, yeah...
0x9f18	0x98	ALTO		(Maybe if he didn't try to get	
				 creative once in a while and	
				 make some freaky dish...)	
0x9fd0	0x98	Gruz		I've been a cook for 40 years...	
				I've spent my whole life pursuing cooking.	
0xa03b	0x98	Gruz		There's no way that the food I	mp_0112 0x9e33
				make won't be delicious!
				Wouldn't you agree Nayu, my boy?
0xa0e0	0x98	Gruz		There's no way my food	
				would not be delicious!	
0xa137	0x98	Gruz		Therefore, the pursuit of	
				new dishes is my mission!	
0xa1cd	0x98	Gruz		Hmm... Because of that crash the	
				all the salt and the pepper in	
				the bottles got mixed in it...	
0xa238	0x98	Gruz		...I'll just finish for now.	
				It might open a new door to	
				unexpected flavors.

0xa4fd	0x98	Gruz		Good to see you again!	
				How have you been?	
0xa540	0x98	ALTO		You too, Gruz...	
				Hey, what's that smell!?	
0xa589	0x98	ALTO		A scent that's somehow sweet, bitter,	
				spicy, and sour all at the same time	
				is emanating from your frying pan...
0xa606	0x98	Gruz		Ah, I was just thinking of making this	
				my newest addition to the menu!	
0xa64e	0x98	Gruz		Come on, Nayu, my boy,	
				how about you give it a	
				try while you're here?	
0xa6a7	0x98	ALTO		W-Well, umm..	
0xa6ce	0x98	ALTO		(I've sampled Gruz's new dishes	
				 before, but they've all been	
				 terrible...)	
0xa747	0x98	ALTO		...I'm pretty full right	
				now, so I'll pass.	
0xa78a	0x98	Gruz		Hmm, really..?	
				That's a shame.	
0xa7c7	0x98	Gruz		Well, maybe one of these	
				days you'll help me	
				develop a new dish again.	
0xa81f	0x98	Gruz		I look forward to it,

0xa9a2	0x98	Gruz		Lyra won't help me with taste testing	
				anymore. Maybe it's because she's	
				reached that certain age.		
0xaa09	0x98	Gruz		Mr. Barton has his own work	
				to do, and I can't take up	
				his time like that.	
0xaa71	0x98	Gruz		In the meantime, my boys Nayu and Cyg, some	
				of the biggest eaters, have just returned...	
				I have to take advantage of this opportunity.
0xab08	0x98	Gruz		Soon, I may have to ask you two for	
				your help sampling my new dish.	
				Look forward to it!	
0xabdd	0x98	Gruz		Lyra and Mr. Barton never have

0xad65	0x98	NOI		Ahaha... Sorry to startle you.	
0xada4	0x98	NOI		I tried to avoid going out because

0xae00	0x98	Gruz		No, I have to apologize for

				after this time.	
0xae5a	0x98	Gruz		You don't seem to be a bad person at all.	mp_0112 0x8e46

0xaebc	0x98	Gruz		...That's right, as a token of our

talk_Antlia
0xb078	0x98	Antlia		Now then, let's get down	
				to business, shall we?	
0xb0c8	0x98	Antlia		Today, I'm going to commission
				a new star shard from Eartha.	
0xb122	0x98	Antlia		Heh, I wonder what kind of scene it will contain...	
				I am looking forward to finding out myself.	
0xb1b7	0x98	Antlia		It seems Reticul and Cetus just	
				arrived on the island earlier.	
0xb217	0x98	Antlia		I never thought we'd run into each other	
				on this island. Just another example of	
				the bond between parent and child, huh?
0xb29c	0x98	Antlia		Hehe, since it's a rare chance,	
				I'll have them tell me tales	
				of their travels.	
0xb332	0x98	Antlia		It seems Reticul and Cetus just	mp_0112 0xb1b7
				arrived on the island earlier.
0xb392	0x98	Antlia		Hehe, since it's a rare chance,	mp_0112 0xb29c
				I'll have them tell me tales
				of their travels.
0xb438	0x98	Antlia		Since the events a year ago,		
				star shards have become more	
				and more difficult to obtain.	
0xb4b3	0x98	Antlia		Now that their source, the other	
				world Lost Heaven, is gone, I	
				suppose it can't be helped...	
0xb51a	0x98	Antlia		At the very least, we should take good	
				care of the shards we already have, right?	
0xb59e	0x98	Antlia		Those beautiful star shards have	
				become more and more difficult	
				to obtain. It's a sad thought...	
0xb620	0x98	Antlia		At the very least, we should take good	mp_0112 0xb51a
				care of the shards we already have, right?
0xb6b2	0x98	Antlia		The world projected in the	
				star shards has long been the	
				object of people's admiration.	
0xb728	0x98	Antlia		Now our world is in imminent	
				danger due to that other	
				world... Ironic.	
0xb7a3	0x98	Antlia		Even so, we must carry on and survive	
				with all our might. For the sake of	
				our precious families...	
0xb835	0x98	Antlia		Our world is in imminent danger	
				due to that beautiful world	
				from the star shards...	
0xb89e	0x98	Antlia		Even so, we must carry on and survive	mp_0112 0xb7a3
				with all our might. For the sake of
				our precious families...
0xb93e	0x98	Antlia		As the anomalies have disrupted the	
				regular schedule of the ferries, goods	
				shortages are occurring everywhere.	
0xb9c0	0x98	Antlia		Now is the time for us merchants	
				to show our skills.	
0xba20	0x98	Antlia		We have to be the first to forecast the situation	
				and deliver supplies as quickly as possible to	
				contain the chaos. Heh, it's going to be busy.	
0xbacc	0x98	Antlia		This is the time for us merchants to show	
				our skills, now that every region is	
				suffering from shortages of supplies.	
0xbb46	0x98	Antlia		Heh, it's going to be very busy soon.	
0xbbdf	0x98	Antlia		These anomalies are occurring	
				throughout the Ciencia Sea...	
				No, throughout the whole world.	
0xbc69	0x98	Antlia		It seems like there's confusion everywhere.	
				I do not know the details myself, but...	
0xbcd9	0x98	Antlia		Anyway, I'm relieved to	
				hear that you're safe.	
				We must thank heaven.	
0xbd5c	0x98	Antlia		We were terribly worried
				while you were in bed.	
0xbdad	0x98	Antlia		Anyway, it's a relief to know that you're safe.	
				We must thank heaven for this good fortune.	
0xbe96	0x98	Antlia		As for Reticul, I thought	
				I had already dealt with	
				these thoughts, but...	
0xbef6	0x98	Antlia		It wasn't until these anomalies	
				started that I realized I was	
				really worried about her.	
0xbf5e	0x98	Antlia		It's a good time to talk	
				things over with her now	
				that she's here.	
0xbffd	0x98	Antlia		Originally, Reticul left because of	
				a disagreement with me, you know.	
0xc05d	0x98	Antlia		It's a good time to talk	mp_0112 0xbf5e
				things over with her now
				that she's here.
0xc10e	0x98	Antlia		I can't believe something like this could	
				occur on such a peaceful island...	
0xc183	0x98	Antlia		Fortunately, Ursamina and I	
				weren't hurt, but I heard	
				some girl was kidnapped.	
0xc1fa	0x98	Antlia		She's not too far in	
				age from Ursamina.	
				I hope she is okay...	
0xc292	0x98	Antlia		I've been visiting this island	
				for over a decade now, so I'm	
				quite truly shocked...	
0xc307	0x98	Antlia		I hope the girl who	
				was taken is okay...	
0xc3a1	0x98	Antlia		Eartha's condition seems to have	
				settled down. I've decided we'll	
				be setting off on the next ship.	
0xc415	0x98	Antlia		Nayuta, make sure to take	
				care of your sister.	
0xc457	0x98	ALTO		Yes, I'll take care of her.	
0xc4ae	0x98	Antlia		Eartha's condition seems to have	mp_0112 0xc3a1
				settled down. I've decided we'll
				be setting off on the next ship.
0xc522	0x98	Antlia		I'm looking forward to seeing	
				her in better shape next time.	
0xc5b5	0x98	Antlia		That Hell Fever was cured...	
				No, no, I can't believe it.	
0xc60e	0x98	Antlia		And I never would have imagined	
				that Nayuta would be able to	
				find that extinct plant...		
0xc691	0x98	Antlia		Hehe, you're a curious boy.	
0xc6f8	0x98	Antlia		I never would have imagined

0xc7e3	0x98	Antlia		I heard Eartha suddenly collapsed...	
0xc821	0x98	Antlia		I've been working with her for a while	
				now. I should go visit her later.	
0xc8a7	0x98	Antlia		Hmm... I wonder if it's	
				a kind of chronic disease.	
0xc8f9	0x98	Antlia		Anyhow, I will come by later.	
				I'll have to prepare a gift...	
0xc9a1	0x98	Antlia		Hmm, I wonder what's	
				wrong with Ursamina...	
0xc9e8	0x98	Antlia		It's not the first time she's	
				been curt, but she seemed to	
				be acting strangely...	
0xcab2	0x98	Antlia		Oh, Nayuta, is that you?	
0xcaeb	0x98	Antlia		To tell you the truth, I've got some	
				things to do, so I'll be staying on	
				this island for two or three more days.	
0xcb9f	0x98	Antlia		Well, now that I've stocked up on a new	
				star shard, I should be going soon.	
0xcc00	0x98	Antlia		The ferry's departure time is...	
				Hmm, looks like there's still time.	
0xcc8a	0x98	Antlia		Once my work is finished,	
				I'll be going home.	
0xccd3	0x98	Antlia		I'm going to come back soon.
				I hope to see you then.	
0xcd6a	0x98	Antlia		Ah, that was a surprise.	
0xcda0	0x98	Antlia		Though this is Remnant Island, where ruins fall	
				several times a year, this is the first time	
				I've experienced a shock like that one.	
0xce33	0x98	Antlia		I'm sure there have been very few cases where	
				things have fallen directly on the island...	
				But I was worried for a minute there.	
0xcee5	0x98	Antlia		Though this is Remnant Island, where ruins fall	mp_0112 0xcda0
				several times a year, this is the first time
				I've experienced a shock like that one.
0xcf78	0x98	Antlia		I was worried for a minute there.	
0xcfe9	0x98	Antlia		Oh, it's you...	
				Nayuta! It's been a long time.	
0xd035	0x98	ALTO		Oh, Antlia, the trader.	
				You're here in town.	
0xd073	0x98	Antlia		Yes, I've come to pick up	
				a star shard that I asked	
				your sister to analyze.	
0xd0e2	0x98	Antlia		I stayed here for the night.
				I was just having a quick smoke	
				until our scheduled meeting time.	
0xd142	0x98	ALTO		Oh, I see.	
0xd16d	0x98	ALTO		If it's the same star shard I'm thinking	
				of, I've seen it myself. It projected a	
				very strange and beautiful sight.	
0xd207	0x98	ALTO		Eartha says it's a good one.	
0xd24a	0x98	Antlia		Oh, really? Thanks for	
				letting me know.	
0xd290	0x98	Antlia		Well, I'll be looking forward to	
				when your sister arrives, then.	
0xd31b	0x98	Antlia		Star shards are a type of crystal found	
				in the Ciencia Sea with the ability to	
				project mysterious scenery.	
0xd3b4	0x98	Antlia		The landscape of this so-called "Lost Heaven."	
0xd3fd	0x98	Antlia		The scenes in each shard are different,	
				and their value varies accordingly.
0xd487	0x98	Antlia		The setup for viewing each shard is also different,	
				so the first task upon finding a new one is always	
				figuring out how to set it up correctly.	
0xd4ff	0x98	Antlia		So that's where you ask a star shard	
				observer like Eartha to analyse it.	
0xd563	0x98	Antlia		She's still young, but her	
				work is thorough, and she's	
				always polite and helpful.	
0xd5f8	0x98	Antlia		Star shards are mysterious crystals	
				found in the Ciencia Sea, and they are	
				popular among nobles and collectors.	
0xd689	0x98	Antlia		Remnant Island sells these shards,	
				and fortunately also has a skilled	
				star shard observer present.	
0xd717	0x98	Antlia		Hehe, your sister provides a	
				sketch of the shards as a bonus...	
				I'm looking forward to that, too.	
talk_Antlia_and_Cetus
0xd7d2	0x98	Antlia		Cetus, I'm glad to see you	
				two again safe and sound. 
0xd82b	0x98	Antlia		I haven't heard from her since	
				she left home, and now there's	
				this current strangeness...	
				I was truly worried.	
0xd8c1	0x98	Cetus		I'm sorry, Uncle Antlia. I took	
				Reticul around with me much	
				longer than I thought I would.	
0xd91f	0x98	Cetus		I'm always telling her to go home,	
				but she's much too stubborn...
0xd994	0x98	Antlia		No, no, you took rather	
				good care of that tomboy.	
0xd9f6	0x98	Antlia		Originally, Reticul left because of	mp_0112 0xbffd
				a disagreement with me, you know.
0xda38	0x98	Antlia		It's a good time to talk	mp_0112 0xbf5e
				things over with her now
				that she's here.
talk_Ursaminor
0xdb65	0x98	Ursaminor		...For a while now, I've been

0xdbcc	0x98	Ursaminor		There's a lot to learn...	
				But it's not so bad.	
0xdc4a	0x98	Ursaminor		It makes me feel kinda satisfied	
				when people buy goods from me. 
0xdcc8	0x98	Ursaminor		...For a while now, I've been	mp_0112 0xdb65
				helping my father with his work.
0xdd2f	0x98	Ursaminor		Though it can be tough...	
				It's not so bad. Maybe I'll sell you	
				something nice one of these days.	
0xddd5	0x98	Ursaminor		Somewhere out there on the Ciencia Sea,	
				my older sister is still going out	
				having adventures...	
0xde3d	0x98	Ursaminor		Just thinking about it	
				makes me feel braver.	
0xde8b	0x98	Ursaminor		Heh, we should both keep	
				working hard today, too.	
0xdf01	0x98	Ursaminor		When I think about my sister, adventuring	
				somewhere out there in the Ciencia Sea,	
				it makes me feel braver myself.	
0xdf7e	0x98	Ursaminor		Heh, we should both keep	mp_0112 0xde8b
				working hard today, too.
0xe01e	0x98	Ursaminor		My father and I are preparing	
				an order for an upcoming	
				shipment of goods.	
0xe07b	0x98	Ursaminor		...I'm sure that in times like these,	
				the people of this island will need	
				a lot of supplies.	
0xe0e9	0x98	Ursaminor		Just let me know if there's anything	
				you need. We'll stock it for you.	
0xe16c	0x98	Ursaminor		We're putting together an order for an upcoming	
				shipment of supplies for the island.	
0xe1c1	0x98	Ursaminor		Tell me if you need	
				something, okay?	
0xe232	0x98	Ursaminor		I finally reunited with my sister...	
0xe27b	0x98	Ursaminor		All I want to do is to live in	
				peace with the people I love.	
0xe2ec	0x98	Ursaminor		I will do whatever it takes	
				to help make that happen.	
0xe361	0x98	Ursaminor		All that matters is to live in	
				peace with my father and sister.
0xe3c2	0x98	Ursaminor		I will do whatever I can	
				to help make that happen.	
0xe446	0x98	Ursaminor		...Sounds like you've had a rough time.
0xe482	0x98	Ursaminor		We've had a pretty rough time here as well...	
				...Though perhaps not as much as you have.	
0xe4ed	0x98	Ursaminor		Anyway, take it easy, will you?	
				Everyone is worried about you.	
0xe576	0x98	Ursaminor		With times like these, my	
				father has been very busy...	
0xe5d2	0x98	Ursaminor		...It's been a lot of work for us, too.	
0xe64c	0x98	Ursaminor		Maybe something is about to	
				happen in these waters...	
0xe699	0x98	Ursaminor		I just hope my sister is okay...	
0xe708	0x98	Ursaminor		I just hope my sister is okay...	mp_0112 0xe699
0xe76b	0x98	Ursaminor		...I've gotta pack my bags.	
0xe7af	0x98	Ursaminor		Father, where are we going next?	
0xe811	0x98	Ursaminor		...Thank goodness.	
0xe848	0x98	Ursaminor		I think I'll visit	
				with my father.	
0xe8a2	0x98	Ursaminor		...I've been trying to keep	
				up with my father's work...	
				...But still...	
0xe909	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew...	
0xe952	0x98	ALTO		(Ursamina is always keeping	
				 her thoughts to herself.)	
0xe9a4	0x98	ALTO		(I wonder if there's a	
				 reason for that...)	
0xea46	0x98	Ursaminor		...That startled me.	
				What was that tremor earlier?	
0xeac0	0x98	Ursaminor		...Ah...	mp_0001 0xd6a4
0xeaed	0x98	Ursaminor		...It spilled my orange juice...	
0xeb69	0x98	Ursaminor		...That startled me...	
0xebb6	0x98	Ursaminor		...My orange juice...	
0xec27	0x98	Ursaminor		.....	mp_0000d 0x70fd
0xec6f	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew.	mp_0004n 0x1b99
0xec9c	0x98	ALTO		(Umm, this girl is Antlia's daughter,	
				 uh, Ursamina, I think?)	
0xecfa	0x98	ALTO		(She seems shy. I haven't seen	
				 her talking with others much.)	
0xed7b	0x98	Ursaminor		...I'm not shy. Don't go	
				around thinking rude things	
				about other people.	
0xede1	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0xee13	0x98	ALTO		S-Sorry.

0xef81	0x98	Ursaminor		...Phew.	mp_0004n 0x1b99
talk_Camelope
0xeff6	0x98	Camelope		Now then... Now that I've had some rest,	
				Let's go see how that girl lives her life.	
0xf064	0x98	Camelope		That one of the esteemed House	mp_0003 0x59e0
				of Camelope would run away and hide
				on this hick island! Preposterous!
0xf0ec	0x98	Camelope		Shall we return her to her	mp_0003 0x5aa4
				family home right away?
0xf174	0x98	Camelope		Oh my, how pitiful...	mp_0003 0x5b26
				One of the esteemed House of Camelope
				would hide out on this hick island.
0xf213	0x98	Camelope		Shall we return her to her	mp_0003 0x5aa4
				family home right away?
0xf2af	0x98	Camelope		It's good to know how Sasha feels.	
				It feels like I got a load off my chest.	
0xf31e	0x98	Camelope		We just needed to calm down and talk things through...	
				It was that simple, and we've wasted so much time.
0xf399	0x98	Camelope		I guess I need to cool my head	
				a bit more from now on, too.	
0xf427	0x98	Camelope		Two years have passed since	
				Sasha left the mansion...	
0xf47e	0x98	Camelope		If that girl is happy with her	
				way of life, then I do not	
				intend to interfere.	
0xf4ee	0x98	Camelope		But living out here in hiding on	
				a remote island like this...
0xf565	0x98	Camelope		...She is still a child after all.	
				She must return to the mansion at once.	
0xf5ff	0x98	Camelope		As long as that girl is still a child,	
				she must be taken back to the mansion.	
0xf667	0x98	Camelope		...Although as much as I try to	
				convince her of that, I can't help	
				but turn it into an argument.	
0xf6e8	0x98	Camelope		Oh my... Where has	
				Norma run off to?	
0xf736	0x98	Camelope		I swear... Leaving the side of her master...	
				I wonder if she's forgotten her role as a maid.	
0xf7e7	0x98	Camelope		We came all the way to	
				this hick island...	
0xf842	0x98	Camelope		And that girl's become even more of	
				a tomboy than before she ran away.	
0xf8c1	0x98	Camelope		I just wish she'd have some sense	
				as the daughter of the noble	
				House of Camelope.	
0xf953	0x98	Camelope		And that girl's become even more of	mp_0112 0xf842

talk_Norma
0xfa6a	0x98	Norma		(Milady...	mp_0003 0x5ffd
				 I hope you are well.)
0xfaaa	0x98	Norma		(Ooh, I'm sure you'll be	mp_0003 0x6032
				 upset to find out I'm
				 here with Mistress...)
0xfb45	0x98	Norma		The Mistress and Milady continued	
				to speak at peace even after that	
				incense wore off.	
0xfbc4	0x98	Norma		I am relieved that that feud of many	
				years has finally been resolved.
0xfc27	0x98	Norma		Nayuta, truly, thank you very much.	
0xfca0	0x98	Norma		Ooh, as I thought,	
				Milady was angry...	
0xfce9	0x98	Norma		It's only natural, with us showing up	
				after she ran away from her parents'	
				home without contacting anyone.	
0xfd7d	0x98	Norma		Ah, it pains me.	
0xfdb7	0x98	Norma		Is there any way for Milady	
				and the Mistress to	
				reconcile...?	
0xfe68	0x98	Norma		Ah, it pains me.	mp_0112 0xfd7d
0xfea2	0x98	Norma		Is there any way for Milady	mp_0112 0xfdb7

talk_Sculp
0x10002	0x98	Sculp		Heya Nayuta, I've got	mp_0000 0x7935
				a question for you.
0x10055	0x98	ALTO		Eh, for me?	mp_0000 0x7988
				What is it?
0x10098	0x98	Sculp		I actually heard this	mp_0000 0x79cb
				from Antlia recently...
0x100f0	0x98	Sculp		Apparently using fertile soil	mp_0000 0x7a23
				will greatly improve crop yield.
0x1014a	0x98	Sculp		It's supposed to be better than manure,	mp_0000 0x7a7d
				and pretty popular on the continent.
0x101ac	0x98	Sculp		But here on Remnant Island,	mp_0000 0x7adf
				I can't find any good soil...
				Do you have any ideas, Nayuta?
0x10224	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, fertile soil, huh?	mp_0000 0x7b57
				I don't think so.
0x1027d	0x98	ALTO		To begin with, Remnant Island soil	mp_0000 0x7bb0
				is probably rocky and full of salt...
0x102e5	0x98	Sculp		I thought that might be the case...	mp_0000 0x7c18
				If you say so, it must be true.
0x10342	0x98	Sculp		Haha, it seems like it's	mp_0000 0x7c75
				nothing but a fantasy for
				us here, eh? Sorry, my bad.
0x1039f	0x98	Sculp		But if you ever do find some	mp_0000 0x7cd2
				good soil somewhere, it'd be
				great if I could use it.
0x10411	0x98	Sculp		Just keep an eye out for it.	mp_0000 0x7d44
0x10453	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, got it.	mp_0000 0x7d86
0x10480	0x98	ALTO		(Fertile soil, huh?	mp_0000 0x7db3
				 If I find any, Maybe I should
				 try bringing it to Sculp?)
0x1063c	0x98	Sculp		*hic*...	
				...Oh, thank goodness!	
				Congratulations, Nayuta!	
0x1068e	0x98	Sculp		When I heard Eartha had collapsed,

0x10814	0x98	Sculp		Ooh, sorry Nayuta...	
				I'm really glad Eartha

0x1086c	0x98	Sculp		*belch*... Thank goodness...	
				Truly, thank goodness...	
0x10928	0x98	Sculp		*hic*... I really am drunk.

talk_Sculp_add
0x10a58	0x98	Sculp		Hmm!? Hey, Nayuta...	mp_0000 0x974f
				Isn't that pretty good soil!?
0x10aac	0x98	Sculp		It's dark, has a soft texture and a fragrant,	mp_0000 0x97a3

				It's of excellent quality.
0x10b39	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I actually found it somewhere...	mp_0000 0x9830
0x10b83	0x98	ALTO		Oh right, if you want it,	mp_0000 0x987a

0x11b6d	0x98	Sculp		"When a child needs to be scolded,

0x11be1	0x98	Axe		Good grief, she completely

0x11c2a	0x98	Axe		Don't her folks run a merchant

0x11c86	0x98	Sculp		Yeah, she's a real hardass,

0x11cda	0x98	Sculp		Well, that's what

0x11eb8	0x98	Axe		...Well, for today, let's just

0x11f12	0x98	Axe		That girl has been working and	
				supporting the house since her	
				parents died when she was 15.	
0x11f94	0x98	Axe		She's had it rougher than any of us.	
				She deserves another chance at survival.	
0x12027	0x98	Axe		Oh man, now I can finally go fishing	
				without a care in the world.	
0x12082	0x98	Axe		Carina said something about having a party...	
				I should probably get ready to go.	
0x12141	0x98	Axe		You know, it looks like	
				they set up a museum	
				near the port.	
0x12197	0x98	Axe		Seems to be run by some guys	
				from the Empire. It sounds	
				pretty interesting.	
0x12205	0x98	Axe		I'm sure Vel would be happy to see it.	
				I should take her to see it sometime.

0x122a0	0x98	Hydol		It's almost time to do

				here I am again.	
0x122ff	0x98	Hydol		Oh yeah... Actually, I have	
				one piece of news for you.	
0x12355	0x98	Hydol		They found the once-thought-extinct	
				Yupina Grass growing in a certain	
				mountain region.	
0x123c5	0x98	Hydol		Now that the anomalies are over, the	
				new cases of Hell Fever patients	
				around the world are abating.	
0x12453	0x98	Hydol		With this, we are now able to	
				treat the remaining patients.	
				A fortunate thing, indeed.	
0x124f1	0x98	Hydol		They found the once-thought-extinct	
				Yupina Grass, so any remaining Hell	
				Fever patients should be cured soon.		
0x1258b	0x98	Hydol		Not that much Yupina Grass	
				was found, I hear...	
0x125ea	0x98	Hydol		This time for sure, we must take care	
				not to let it become extinct again.	
0x12689	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta, you... It looks	
				like you're finally awake.	
				That's wonderful news.	
0x126ea	0x98	ALTO		Dr. Hydrol... You're	
				back on the island?	
0x12734	0x98	Hydol		Yes, I returned to San Ceriz for a while,	
				but a few days ago, I got the news that you	
				washed ashore on the island unconscious.	
0x127bb	0x98	Hydol		In the midst of all this chaos in the world,	
				I come and find this island covered in debris,	
				and there's even some kind of fairy about...	
0x12847	0x98	Hydol		I almost can't believe what's	
				going on right now, myself.	
0x1289d	0x98	NOI		S-Sorry to	
				frighten you...	
0x128d7	0x98	Hydol		No, don't worry about it.	
				At least, you don't seem	
				to be dangerous.	
0x12938	0x98	Hydol		I'm a bit confused myself, but...	
				I must make sure to do my job as	
				a doctor properly.	
0x129a3	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta, Noi, you should use this time	
				to rest your minds and bodies for now.	
0x12a37	0x98	Hydol		Anomalies are occurring all over the world...	
				That's the current state of the Ciencia Sea.	
0x12ab1	0x98	Hydol		The frequency of ferry travel	
				has been limited, so I plan	
				to stay here for a while.	
0x12b18	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta, Noi, you should use this time	mp_0112 0x129a3

0x12c95	0x98	Hydol		Eartha should continue to	
				feel better from now on.	
0x12ced	0x98	Hydol		While I will keep an eye on her just to	
				be sure, there should be no need to fear	
				the symptoms of Hell Fever anymore.		
0x12d86	0x98	ALTO		Is that so...? Thank goodness.	mp_0005c 0x5567
0x12dc2	0x98	ALTO		Dr. Hydrol, you've been	
				a big help this time.	
0x12e0f	0x98	Hydol		Haha, I didn't do much.	
0x12e51	0x98	Hydol		It's all thanks to you bringing	
				the Yupina Grass to me.	
0x12ec3	0x98	Hydol		This may have been a miracle brought	
				forth by the love from her family.	
0x12f65	0x98	Hydol		Due to the effects of the Yupina	
				Grass, Eartha should continue to	
				feel better from now on.	
0x12fe4	0x98	Hydol		While I will keep an eye on her just to	mp_0112 0x12ced

0x1307d	0x98	Hydol		This may have been a miracle brought	mp_0112 0x12ec3
				forth by the love from her family.
0x1310d	0x98	Hydol		Soon, I plan to board the ferry	
				bound for San Ceriz.	
0x1316b	0x98	Hydol		Nayuta, please continue to take	
				good care of your sister.	
0x131fc	0x98	Hydol		And thank you for all the assistance	
				you've given me with my work. You've	
				been a big help.	
0x13259	0x98	Hydol		If you are ever not feeling well,	
				you can always come visit me there,	
0x132af	0x98	Hydol		I plan to stay for a little	
				while longer. I will check	
				back in as soon as I can.	
0x13351	0x98	Hydol		I've got some medical records to sort through.
				I doubt I'll be ready to start seeing patients soon.	
0x133c0	0x98	Hydol		But I don't want to keep my	
				patients waiting too long...	
0x13413	0x98	Hydol		Anyhow, once my paperwork is complete,	
				I'll go pay a visit to the elder.	
0x134ba	0x98	Hydol		But I really appreciate the	
				air and the beautiful scenery	
				in this village.	
0x13524	0x98	Hydol		I always look forward to the	
				days I visit here, too.	
0x135dc	0x98	Hydol		Umm, for now, I'll pay a visit	
				to the elder, and then...	
0x13629	0x98	Hydol		...Hmm, but I'm in a bit of a bind...	
				But I'm not sure if I can do anything

0x13697	0x6B	ALTO		Question

0x13888	0x98	Dorado		That would be Remnant Island's...

0x13a2b	0x98	Mensa		We have traveled the area around the Cienca

0x13a88	0x98	Mensa		According to our source,	
				it seems likely that he	
				is on this island, but...	
0x13afa	0x98	Mensa		...Phew, he's been giving	
				us quite a hard time.	
0x13b60	0x98	Mensa		We have traveled the area around the Cienca	mp_0112 0x13a2b
				Sea in search of a certain individual.
0x13bbd	0x98	Mensa		We have to find him soon...	
				He's been giving us quite a	
				hard time.	
0x13c38	0x98	Mensa		Heh, this time, we're here	
				as legitimate tourists.	
0x13c92	0x98	Mensa		Mishy wanted to visit this	
				island after a while, so	
				we took the time to come.	
0x13d08	0x98	Mensa		Ophiuchus took him out for	
				a walk earlier, but...	
0x13d5f	0x98	Mensa		...They've been gone for a while.	
				I wonder where they went.	
0x13de4	0x98	Mensa		Mishy and Ophiuchus have been	
				gone for a while now...	
0x13e35	0x98	Mensa		...Heh, how funny would it	
				be if he ran away again?		
0x13ed5	0x98	Mensa		I don't know what's become of our world...	
				But panicking won't solve anything.	
0x13f69	0x98	Mensa		In times like these, you just	
				have to stand your ground and	
				 do what needs to be done.	
0x13fc4	0x98	Mensa		Heh, you seem	
				to understand.	
0x1402f	0x98	Mensa		In times like these, you just have	mp_0112 0x13f69
				to stand your ground and do what

0x1408a	0x98	Mensa		Heh, you seem	mp_0112 0x13fc4
				to understand.
0x14103	0x98	Mensa		It looks like Mishy has been	
				wandering all over the island.
0x1415e	0x98	Mensa		He must be uncomfortable	
				in this situation too.	
0x141a8	0x98	Mensa		Until we can return to the mansion,	
				Ophiuchus will need to look after him.	
0x14235	0x98	Mensa		Mishy must be uncomfortable	
				in this situation too.		
0x14287	0x98	Mensa		Until we can return to the mansion,	mp_0112 0x141a8
				Ophiuchus will need to look after him.
0x14322	0x98	Mensa		Because of everything happening,	
				the ferry doesn't seem to be	
				running as often.	
0x14381	0x98	Mensa		Now that there are also signs of war...	
				It might be safer for us to just stay	
				on this island for now.
0x143f3	0x98	Mensa		We have to move carefully	
				if we want to get Mishy	
				back to the mansion safely.	
0x14485	0x98	Mensa		With all the abnormal weather that's	
				going on, I'm starting to worry about	
				the land that Mishy inherited.	
0x14502	0x98	Mensa		I need to contact the company	
				and make sure as much of it	
				is preserved as possible.	
0x145be	0x98	Mensa		The millionaire put much of	
				his mira into preserving	
				nature before he died.	
0x14624	0x98	Mensa		His legacy was to be the vast tract	
				of lush green land he owned.	
0x14683	0x98	Mensa		His family has been plotting	
				to sell it, but...	
0x146fb	0x98	Mensa		Hehe, now that we've found	
				Mishy, they won't be able	
				to do anything by themselves.	
0x14799	0x98	Mensa		The millionaire hired us to find and	
				take care of Mishy, and to manage the	
				land that will be his legacy.	
0x1481b	0x98	Mensa		Well, it's a pain in the ass...	
				But I have to finish what he	
				asked us to do.	
0x148c4	0x98	Mensa		Hmm... If we still	
				can't find him after	
				all that fuss...
0x1491d	0x98	Mensa		It's possible that he is	
				no longer on this island.	
0x14970	0x98	Mensa		We might want to consider	
				searching elsewhere.	
0x149f0	0x98	Mensa		It's possible that he is	mp_0112 0x1491d
				no longer on this island.
0x14a43	0x98	Mensa		We might want to consider	mp_0112 0x14970

0x14b3b	0x98	Ophiuchus		Yeah, he should be fine,

0x14b94	0x98	Ophiuchus		But this is extraordinarily unusual weather,	
				so it's hard to say either way...

0x269b0	0x98	Victor		Hmm, the armory...? That does not

0x26a22	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1

0x28f38	0x98	ALTO		Hmm, you're right...

0x28fc8	0x98	ALTO		So, Antlia.	
0x29041	0x98	ALTO		The flowers you were supposed to bring

0x290db	0x98	Antlia		Ah, they are popular as offerings	
				throughout the world, including	
				the Ciencia Sea.	
0x2918b	0x06	Antlia		ANI_SIT1_GESTURE1	
0x291bc	0x98	Antlia		It's called the Fiona Flower. They're	
				pure white and grow in the western	
				part of the continent.	
0x2923b	0x98	Antlia		Also, the petals of the flower	
				glow faintly in the dark. It's	
				a very beautiful sight.	
0x292bb	0x98	Antlia		Unfortunately, they don't seem	
				to grow in the Ciencia Sea...

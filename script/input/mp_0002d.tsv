0x64c	0x98	Aulbath		That Zext man is a	
				formidable opponent...	
0x6a6	0x98	Aulbath		And without us knowing, Nayuta...	
				You, too, have grown strong.	
0x6ff	0x98	Aulbath		Perhaps you have the power	
				to overcome that man.	
0x750	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I won't lose!	
0x78f	0x98	ALTO		I want to see

0x8fa	0x98	Aulbath		Take care, my student.	
0x93f	0x98	ALTO		...Yes!!	
0x9a1	0x98	Aulbath		I cannot be of much	
				assistance with these	
				injuries...	
0x9eb	0x98	Aulbath		You may have the power	
				to overcome that man.	
0xa3b	0x98	Aulbath		......................	
				Take care, my student.	
0xa8f	0x98	ALTO		(Master... Maybe he's	
				 worried about Cygna.)	
0xae9	0x98	ALTO		(...Cygna...)	
0xb3e	0x98	Aulbath		If you don't give up,	
				I'm sure you will find the

0xbb1	0x98	Aulbath		My student... Do whatever	
				it takes to bring that	
				young lady back.

0xfcf	0x98	Aulbath		Oh, it's you, Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x44ae
				You have... That is a
				training book, is it not?
0x1036	0x98	ALTO		Yes, Cygna gave it to me earlier.	mp_0002 0x4515
0x1073	0x98	ALTO		He said it would be	mp_0002 0x4552
				useful in my training.
0x10b4	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm, is that so...?	mp_0002 0x4593
0x111d	0x98	Aulbath		It seems you've been gradually	mp_0002 0x45fc

0x1175	0x98	Aulbath		...Yes, if you collect a few more	mp_0002 0x4654

0x11ee	0x98	ALTO		Huh...? A skill?	mp_0002 0x46cd
0x121c	0x98	ALTO		Oh, yeah, Cygna used them	mp_0002 0x46fb

0x1273	0x98	Aulbath		Hmm... When facing formidable	mp_0002 0x4752

0x12d4	0x98	Aulbath		In time, I plan to teach you	mp_0002 0x47b3

0x132c	0x98	Aulbath		Be patient, Nayuta.	mp_0002 0x480b

0x1393	0x98	ALTO		Haha... I'm rather	mp_0002 0x4872

0x1af0	0x98	Aulbath		By continuously landing hits,	mp_0002 0x4fcf
				you will accumulate CHAIN and
				gain various benefits.
0x1b64	0x98	Aulbath		For example, increased attack power.	mp_0002 0x5043
				With these benefits, you can very
				much turn a fight in your favor.
0x1bfb	0x98	Aulbath		However, CHAIN will be interrupted	mp_0002 0x50da
				after a certain amount of time. It will
				also be interrupted after taking damage.
0x1c82	0x98	Aulbath		To use CHAIN effectively, you will need	mp_0002 0x5161
				to cooperate with your allies to keep
				your attacks from being interrupted.
0x1d28	0x98	Aulbath		There are more powerful	mp_0002 0x5207
				benefits of CHAIN.
0x1d6f	0x98	Aulbath		If CHAIN is 80 or more, the experience	mp_0002 0x524e
				you earn will increase. At 100 or more,
				all sword attacks will be critical hits.
0x1e0b	0x98	Aulbath		Furthermore, if CHAIN is 120 or higher,	mp_0002 0x52ea
				you will gradually restore your health.
0x1e91	0x98	Aulbath		Though it is difficult to accumulate	mp_0002 0x5370
				that much, these benefits can be a
				powerful ally in a tough battle.
0x1f15	0x98	Aulbath		It is a good idea to keep this in mind,	mp_0002 0x53f4
				and to fight actively when possible.
0x1fa4	0x98	Aulbath		If you unleash "Spinning Cut,"	mp_0002 0x5483
				you can hit flying monsters.
0x2005	0x98	Aulbath		You can also launch smaller monsters into	mp_0002 0x54e4
				the air. If you can master it, you can gain
				an advantage in your battles.
0x2085	0x98	Aulbath		However, it is impossible	mp_0002 0x5564
				to launch larger enemies.
				Something to keep in mind.
0x211c	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x55fb
				more powerful secret technique, "Vacuum Blade."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x21f7	0x98	Aulbath		"Down Thrust" is an attack that uses the	mp_0002 0x56d6
				momentum of a fall to increase its power.
0x2266	0x98	Aulbath		Its distinguishing feature is	mp_0002 0x5745
				that, of all the sword techniques,
				it boasts the highest power.
0x22eb	0x98	Aulbath		Although it can leave a wide opening,	mp_0002 0x57ca
				there are many different ways to use it.
				You can try finding them out on your own.
0x2390	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x586f
				more powerful secret technique, "Meteor Attack."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x246f	0x98	Aulbath		"Kamaitachi" unleashes an	mp_0002 0x594e
				intense stroke of your sword
				with a quick step.
0x24dd	0x98	Aulbath		This technique, infused with sword chi,	mp_0002 0x59bc
				can damage enemies against which sword
				attacks are otherwise ineffective.
0x2564	0x98	Aulbath		Additionally, its power lies is in its	mp_0002 0x5a43
				longer reach. It is possible to attack
				from a distance with this technique.
0x261e	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x5afd
				more powerful secret technique, "Divine Wind."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x26f9	0x98	Aulbath		"Swallow Return" can cut down all	mp_0002 0x5bd8
				surrounding enemies in an instant.
0x2761	0x98	Aulbath		It also has the effect of pulling the enemies	mp_0002 0x5c40
				towards you. This is very powerful in melee.
0x27ed	0x98	Aulbath		It is one of the most difficult sword techniques,	mp_0002 0x5ccc
				but if mastered, it can be a powerful tool.
				Never tire, and keep practicing.
0x28c2	0x98	Aulbath		When CHAIN is 20 or more, you can unleash the	mp_0002 0x5da1
				more powerful secret technique, "Fallen Lotus."
				You can confirm its true nature in battle.
0x29a0	0x98	Aulbath		There exist two types of swords:	mp_0002 0x5e7f
				One-handed and two-handed swords.
0x2a05	0x98	Aulbath		One-handed swords have great maneuverability, and	mp_0002 0x5ee4
				are capable of delivering quick, successive attacks.
				Generally, they are considered easier to handle.
0x2aa3	0x98	Aulbath		On the other hand, two-handed swords have higher power,	mp_0002 0x5f82
				and easily knock down enemies. However, they leave a
				larger opening between attacks and are harder to handle.
0x2b72	0x98	Aulbath		Each has its advantages and disadvantages...	mp_0002 0x6051
				I cannot say which is superior. Choose a
				sword most comfortable for you to use.
0x2c2d	0x98	Aulbath		Some monsters can cause	mp_0002 0x610c
				various status conditions.
0x2c97	0x98	Aulbath		"Poison" rapidly saps your stamina, and	mp_0002 0x6176
				"paralysis" greatly slows your movement...
0x2d26	0x98	Aulbath		"Freezing" can stop your movements,	mp_0002 0x6205
				"confusion" derails your actions.
0x2d96	0x98	Aulbath		Though all can be reversed with time,	mp_0002 0x6275
				there exists equipment that improves
				resistance and status recovery items.
0x2e1d	0x98	Aulbath		If you are heading to a dangerous	mp_0002 0x62fc
				battle, make sure to be prepared.

0x53b	0x98	Cetus		You really saved us. I don't

0x5ad	0x98	ALTO		Haha, I'm glad we were able to help.	
0x5f4	0x98	NOI		Return and don't take any side trips.

0x65b	0x98	Cetus		Thank you, Noi.	
0x68b	0x98	Cetus		...At first, I thought you were paranoid, but you

0x711	0x98	NOI		N-Not particularly...	
				That's not what I intended.	
0x75e	0x98	NOI		If you humans go home without a

0x7ad	0x98	ALTO		(Hahaha... Come to think of it,

0x844	0x98	Cetus		We're going to rest a little

0x8a6	0x98	Cetus		Nayuta and Noi, truly,

0x937	0x98	Reticul		Though it's too bad we weren't	mp_0101 0x4c4c

0x9a2	0x98	Reticul		For now, it's a relief to	mp_0101 0x4cc3

0xa47	0x98	ALTO		(Well, I guess that's just her personality.)	
0xa8d	0x98	Reticul		Are you really sure there isn't	
				any treasure to be found here?	
0xaf1	0x98	Reticul		Because this place is

0xb41	0x98	ALTO		Well, um... Reticul,	
				you noticed?	
0xb7f	0x98	Reticul		Yeah, kinda.	
0xbad	0x98	Reticul		I know what the insides of star shards look like.	
				I've sneaked glimpses of Papa's merchandise.	
0xc29	0x98	Reticul		More importantly, my gut tells me thisï½ž:	
				This is a world that's worth protecting.	
0xc9e	0x98	ALTO		(Reticul... You seem to have	
				 truly keen intuition.)	
0xcf1	0x98	NOI		(Ooh, I hope she doesn't

0xd6c	0x98	Reticul		Even so, it's really pretty...	
0xdad	0x98	Reticul		Well, even though we didn't find any	
				treasure, I'm glad we were able to	
				catch such a beautiful sight.	
0xe2a	0x98	Reticul		It feels like we just had a great adventure...

				accomplishment I've been looking for.

0x65b4	0x98	ALTO		Sure, Cygna's skill with the sword	
				is great... But I can't believe he	
				thinks he can fight them alone...	
0x6640	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x6668	0x98	ALTO		I don't know... It just doesn't	
				feel like something Cygna would do.	
0x66d7	0x98	ALTO		Maybe something happened to	
				him we don't know about...	
0x6738	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x6761	0x98	NOI	#6A	Like what...?	
0x6798	0x06	ALTO		ANI_DENY	
0x67be	0x98	ALTO		...I don't know exactly...	
				But in any case, there's no	
				way we can just let him go.	
0x6844	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x686e	0x98	ALTO		Noi, will you come with me?	
0x68b1	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x68da	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah...	
0x690b	0x98	ALTO		It might be true that I'm not	
				able to stand up to Zext.	
0x695c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x6986	0x98	ALTO		...But, with your help,	
				I feel like I can do anything.	
0x69e1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x6a06	0x98	ALTO		Going forward... I'll

0x6b77	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THANKS	
0x6b9f	0x98	ALTO		Thanks, Noi.	
0x6be8	0x98	NOI	#6A	I-I'm not doing this	
				for you or anything!	
0x6c32	0x98	NOI	#6A	Recovering the Master	
				Gear was my goal	
				from the start...	
0x6c9b	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x6cc4	0x98	NOI	#6A	I can't back down just

0x6d48	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, I know.	
0x6d84	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x6dae	0x98	ALTO		...Well then, brace yourself!	
0x6ef1	0x07	System	#3C	Cygna is no longer with you.	
0x7001	0xCE	Objective		Zext should be somewhere in the temple. Let's look for him!

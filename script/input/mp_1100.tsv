0x5f4	0x98	NOI		Return and don't take any detours.

0x65b	0x98	Cetus		Thank you, Noi.	
0x68b	0x98	Cetus		...At the beginning you told us to be vigilant,

0x711	0x98	NOI		N-Not particularly...

0xb7f	0x98	Reticul		Yeah, well.	
0xbad	0x98	Reticul		If it is the scenes of the Star Shards,

0xc29	0x98	Reticul		More than anything, my intuition told me.	
				This place is a world we have to protect.

0xba0	0x98	Serpent		With this, the preparations for the Star Festival	
				are in order. The ancestors too will be pleased	
				with the abundant harvest this year.	
0xc47	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta and fairy too.	
				Good work.	
				Allow me to thank you again.	
0xce1	0x98	Serpent		Oh, fairy!	
0xd0e	0x98	Serpent		I thought a brilliant light was fired	
				at the cape, and you have come	
				to visit again, it seems!	
0xd8d	0x98	NOI		W-What is this...?	
0xdbe	0x98	ALTO		Elder treats Noi	
				as something holy,	
				you see...	
0xe0a	0x98	Serpent		It seems you are different	
				than the past Noi...	
				Please take your time.	
0xe71	0x98	Serpent		Please allow all of the	
				islanders to welcome you.	
0xec4	0x98	NOI		T-Thank you...	
0xf2b	0x98	Serpent		Now that the Star Festival is	
				close, it seems the fairy has	
				come to visit us once again...	
0xfa6	0x98	Serpent		Because it was cancelled	
				last year due to abnormalities,	
				it will be even livelier than normal.	
0x104d	0x98	Serpent		Fairy, please take your time.	
0x108d	0x98	Serpent		Please allow all of the	mp_0116 0xe71
				islanders to welcome you.	
0x1118	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, you work hard	
				every day with your	
				Handyman Shop work.	
0x1176	0x98	Serpent		You help all of the villagers	
				quite a bit as well.	
0x11ca	0x98	ALTO		Haha, that is my work, you see.	
0x1209	0x98	ALTO		Elder, if you too need any help,	
				please submit a request	
				anytime.	
0x1268	0x98	Serpent		Yes, yes,	
				that is a good idea.	
0x12a8	0x98	Serpent		This year's Star Festival is close...	
				At that time, I'll rely on your	
				help.	
0x133c	0x98	Serpent		Thanks to you, Nayuta,	
				the people of the village have	
				been helped quite a bit.	
0x13ab	0x98	Serpent		This year's Star Festival is close...	mp_0116 0x12a8
				At that time, I'll rely on your	
				help.	
0x144d	0x98	Serpent		The aspect of that moon...	
				Whenever I look at it, I feel	
				the end of the world coming.	
0x14c3	0x98	Serpent		But, as Elder, I must work	
				to assure our future.	
0x1515	0x98	Serpent		Because I've not long to live, I don't	
				have time for strong emotions...Anyway,	
				we all must do what we can.	
0x15c8	0x98	Serpent		As Elder, I must work	
				to assure our future.	
0x1615	0x98	Serpent		...For now anyway, we all	
				must do what we can.	
0x169b	0x98	Serpent		Until Master Orvus came to Remnant	
				Island, we had a problem of "strength."	
0x1707	0x98	Serpent		Now, these are already the times where you	
				can't gain anything by doing military deeds.	
				Is there any meaning in strength?	
0x17a1	0x98	Serpent		But, because he picked up Cygna,	
				it seems he has found the answer,	
				"the strength to protect."	
0x181f	0x98	Serpent		...It seems Cygna's disappeared...	
				I hope he is well.	
0x189e	0x98	Serpent		With Cygna's presence, Master Orvus	
				seems to have found the answer to	
				be "the strength to protect."	
0x1922	0x98	Serpent		...It seems Cygna's disappeared...	mp_0116 0x181f
				I hope he is well.	
0x19af	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, fairy.	
				Please do not lose hope.	
0x19f8	0x98	Serpent		That young lady called Kureha too,	
				I'm sure she is still safe...	
				The villagers believe this too.	
0x1a79	0x98	Serpent		Anyway, now we must make	
				perfect preparations for the	
				abnormalities.	
0x1b06	0x98	Serpent		That young lady called Kureha too,	mp_0116 0x19f8
				I'm sure she is still safe...	
				The villagers believe this too.	
0x1b87	0x98	Serpent		Anyway, now we must make	mp_0116 0x1a79
				perfect preparations for the	
				abnormalities.	
0x1c22	0x98	Serpent		That young lady...	
				The villagers explain it	
				as a "kidnapping."	
0x1c81	0x98	Serpent		If I said the truth, it would cause	
				a panic, so I shouldn't for now.	
0x1ce7	0x98	Serpent		...The one I'm worried about is you.	
				I can't believe you are involved	
				with <Lost Heaven>...	
0x1d63	0x98	Serpent		The lost paradise, the legendary	
				Shangri-La... Though it is called by	
				many names, they are all fiction.	
0x1deb	0x98	Serpent		I can't believe you reached that place...	
				My blood is resisting.	
0x1e75	0x98	Serpent		I will entrust that young lady and	
				Cygna to you.	
0x1ec7	0x98	Serpent		However...I am worried about you, too.	
				Definitely return safely, OK?	
0x1f7d	0x98	Serpent		Just now, the young lady named	
				Kureha came to greet me.	
0x1fd6	0x98	Serpent		Goodness gracious, what	
				a sweet girl.	
0x201d	0x98	Serpent		Hohoho, it seems the pain	
				in my back went somewhere.	
0x209b	0x98	Serpent		Kureha is a	
				very sweet girl.	
0x20d9	0x98	Serpent		Hohoho, it seems the pain	mp_0116 0x201d
				in my back went somewhere.	
0x2165	0x98	Serpent		Ow-ow-ow... Celebration is 	
				unbecoming of one my age.	
0x21bc	0x98	Serpent		H-However, well...	
				Most importantly, Eartha is cured.	
				There is nothing better than this.	
0x2235	0x98	Serpent		Before long I will crawl over	
				to visit her, so please look	
				forward to it.	
0x229f	0x98	ALTO		Umm, please don't	
				work too hard...	
0x2308	0x98	Serpent		Though I would like to express my	
				joy with cheers of "Hooray!"...	
				Having back pain is painful...	
0x2389	0x98	Serpent		Well most importantly, Eartha is cured.	
				Before long I will go visit her, so please	
				look forward to it.	
0x2446	0x98	Serpent		...Sorry, Nayuta.	
				I know nothing with regard to	
				Eartha's illness.	
0x24a8	0x98	Serpent		While I know of many folk remedies,	
				they are for illnesses other than 	
				Hell Fever...	
0x251d	0x98	Serpent		Even though the knowledge I've accumulated	
				over the years is one of my redeeming	
				features, this feeling is miserable...	
0x25dd	0x98	Serpent		I know nothing with regard to	
				Eartha's Hell Fever...	
0x2633	0x98	Serpent		Even though the knowledge I've accumulated	mp_0116 0x251d
				over the years is one of my redeeming	
				features, this feeling is miserable...	
0x2701	0x98	Serpent		I saw Dr. Hydol	
				running over...	
0x2742	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, is it true that	
				Eartha collapsed?	
0x278d	0x98	Serpent		Is that so...Then I'm worried.	
				If the doctor has come,	
				then I think it's serious...	
0x2829	0x98	Serpent		I hope it is not a difficult illness...	
0x28a9	0x98	Serpent		It is said that once, a	
				disaster called the	
				<Great Flood> occurred.	
0x290d	0x98	Serpent		By it, almost all the land	
				in the Ciencia Sea was	
				submerged...	
0x296c	0x98	Serpent		After that, by falling ruins,	
				in this sea, this island of	
				"remnants" was made.	
0x29db	0x98	Serpent		That is how this island came	
				to be called <Remnant Island>.	
				...Did you learn something?	
0x2a7b	0x98	Serpent		After the <Great Flood>, by falling ruins,	
				it is said this <Remnant Island> was	
				made, little by little.	
0x2b03	0x98	Serpent		Well, as for whether the <Great Flood>	
				really occurred, I do not know.	
0x2ba1	0x98	Serpent		Falling ruins... Though I have experienced	
				it many times since I was young, it is	
				a profoundly mysterious phenomenon.	
0x2c37	0x98	Serpent		It is a phenomenon that occurs two or	
				three times per year in the Ciencia	
				Sea.	
0x2ca6	0x98	Serpent		No matter the famous researcher,	
				as yet no one has been able to	
				explain it...	
0x2d14	0x98	ALTO		That's right, I asked the professor	
				at Saint Cerize academy about	
				it, but...	
0x2d7e	0x98	ALTO		Right now, we have no idea at	
				all as to the source.	
0x2dd0	0x98	Serpent		Hmm, that's right.	
				There are theories that the "Star Shards"	
				that fall from the same sky are related...	
0x2e58	0x98	Serpent		In the future, I wonder if the day will come	
				when some researcher with a good head	
				will somehow be able to explain this mystery.	
0x2ef9	0x98	ALTO		(...If possible, I would like to try	
				 to explain it with my own hands...)	
0x2f61	0x6B	Serpent		Surprise	
0x2f96	0x98	Serpent		Oh that's right, changing the subject...	
				Before long, I plan to make a rare	
				establishment on this island.	
0x3020	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x3052	0x98	ALTO		A rare establishment...?	
0x308a	0x98	Serpent		Yes, when I heard the story,	
				I was rather surprised.	
0x30e0	0x98	Serpent		The place is near the harbor.	
				Nayuta, if you have time,	
				you should take a look.	
0x318a	0x98	Serpent		Before long, I plan to make a rare	
				establishment on this island.	
0x31ec	0x98	Serpent		Though I heard it will be a little	
				longer before the official opening...	
				Hoho, I am looking forward to it.	
0x3277	0x98	Serpent		From my back pain too,	
				somehow I am getting	
				a good feeling.	
0x32fb	0x98	Serpent		It seems the official opening will be	
				soon, and I am looking forward to it.	
0x3368	0x98	Serpent		From my back pain too, somehow I am	
				getting a good feeling.	
				Hohoho...	
0x3404	0x98	Serpent		T-That vibration just now...	
				My back...Gah...	
0x3453	0x98	Serpent		...N-Nayuta...	
				I'm sorry but...Now isn't a good time...	
				My back is shaking...	
0x34e9	0x98	Serpent		...I-I'm sorry but, now isn't	
				a good time to talk...	
				My back is shaking...	
0x358a	0x98	Serpent		Oh, Nayuta, it seems you've returned	
				to the island with Cygna.	
0x35ea	0x98	ALTO		Yes, Elder. I've just returned.	
0x3629	0x98	Serpent		Yes, yes, you are a well-mannered	
				child, Nayuta.	
0x367b	0x98	Serpent		This must be the result of the training	
				my wife gave to Eartha in raising you.	
				I must thank her.	
0x36fc	0x98	Serpent		Yes, you are already 15...	
				Now that you've entered Saint Cerize	
				Academy, you can't play as much as before.	
0x3787	0x98	Serpent		Like when I was a child, study hard	
				and I'm sure your future will be──	
0x3815	0x6B	Serpent		Exclamation	
0x384a	0x98	Serpent		Guh!?	
0x3872	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x38a4	0x98	ALTO		E-Elder...Are you all right!?	
0x38e1	0x98	Serpent		Y-Yes, when I give passionate	
				lectures, by chronic back pain...	
0x3942	0x98	Serpent		A-Anyway, while you are in the	
				village, you should relax, yes.	
0x39a2	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x39fc	0x98	Serpent		Oh, ow-ow-ow...	
				As I thought, I have not won	
				the battle of the years.	
0x3a62	0x98	Serpent		A-Anyway, while you are in the	mp_0116 0x3942
				village, you should relax, yes.	
talk_Canis					
0x3b0c	0x98	Canis		Speaking of the Star Festival, it is a	
				once-a-year festival of Remnant Island.	
0x3b7a	0x98	Canis		We wish on the stars, and offer up	
				our thanks for this island and sea.	
0x3be0	0x98	Canis		Last year's was cancelled, but...	
				The fields and fish this year	
				were better than usual.	
0x3c56	0x98	Canis		I'm sure this is a gift from heaven for	
				us, who overcame the abnormalities.	
				Uhuhu, we must celebrate all out!	
0x3d0a	0x98	Canis		The truth is, I plan to sponsor the	
				eating contest for the Star Festival	
				this year.	
0x3d7c	0x98	Canis		We will eat and drink our fill,	
				and give thanks to this island	
				and the sea.	
0x3e1c	0x98	Canis		I'm especially happy that it seems	
				we will be able to hold the festival	
				this year!	
0x3e8d	0x98	Canis		...It would be good if Cygna	
				and Kureha could come too...	
0x3ee6	0x98	ALTO		...That's right...	
0x3f40	0x98	Canis		...I'm sorry, being melancholy	
				isn't like me.	
0x3f8d	0x98	Canis		For those children who are not	
				here too... Everyone is looking	
				forward to seeing them.	
0x4038	0x98	Canis		I wonder how long this weather will last.	
0x4082	0x98	Canis		There are never times when "snow" falls,	
				and it's somehow chilly...	
0x40e5	0x98	Canis		You see, because I am frail,	
				sudden changes in climate	
				disturb my health.	
0x414d	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4177	0x6B	NOI		Sweatdrop	
0x41a8	0x98	ALTO		(Aunt Janis...frail...?	
				 Hmm, that's the first I've heard of that...)	
0x4234	0x98	Canis		The climate has been changing rapidly lately.	
				Somehow, it's disturbing my health.	
0x42a5	0x98	Canis		I'm sure it's because I'm frail.	
0x431c	0x98	Canis		Soon it will be the season for the	
				annual customary "Star Festival."	
0x4380	0x98	Canis		Aah, because I like festivals,	
				I'm looking forward to it, but...	
0x43e0	0x98	Canis		As expected, in this situation,	
				we may have to cancel it.	
0x4461	0x98	Canis		As expected, this isn't the	
				time for a festival.	
0x44b1	0x98	Canis		Aah, it's too bad.	
				The "Star Festival" this	
				year is canceled.	
0x4543	0x98	Canis		I couldn't protect Kureha...	
0x4580	0x98	Canis		Aaaaaaaaaaah...	
				I'm a failure as the Elder's daughter.	
0x45d6	0x98	ALTO		...It will be all right, Mrs. Janis.	
0x461a	0x98	ALTO		I will show you I can bring	
				back Kureha...	
				So cheer up.	
0x466f	0x98	Canis		Nayuta...	
				Thank you for cheering me up.	
0x46b6	0x98	Canis		That's right...Especially at a time like this,	
				everyone in the village must pull together.	
0x4758	0x98	Canis		Nayuta...	mp_0116 0x466f
				Thank you for cheering me up.	
0x479f	0x98	Canis		I'm the Elder's daughter...	
				I have to cheer up and pull the	
				villagers together.	
0x4829	0x98	Canis		Lupus jumped in and	
				went to pull his father in.	
0x4878	0x98	Canis		Good grief. That child has been	
				careless for a long time...	
0x48d3	0x98	Canis		Because father's back is weak.	
				We can't make use of him.	
0x495f	0x98	Canis		It seems Kureha	
				is a very good girl.	
0x49a3	0x98	Canis		She has a good disposition,	
				and she is very polite.	
0x49f6	0x98	Canis		She is truly the spitting image	
				of me when I was young～.	
0x4a4f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4aa9	0x98	Canis		Kureha is truly the spitting image

				she will be even more beautiful.	
				No doubt about it!!

0x4bde	0x98	Canis		Oh, father...	
				And just when Eartha	
				is finally better.	
0x4c32	0x98	Canis		...Uhu, that's right,	
				Eartha's cured, right!?	
0x4c7f	0x98	Canis		This time, let's leave father alone,	
				and celebrate enthusiastically together!	
0x4cec	0x6B	Serpent		Sweatdrop	
0x4d3b	0x98	Serpent		J-Janis...	
				My back is shaking, so please	
				don't speak so loudly.	
0x4ddd	0x98	Canis		My, I'm sorry I left you alone.	
				Ohohohoho...	
0x4e60	0x98	Canis		Ohoho, though he told me to not	
				speak loudly, happy things cannot	
				be helped.	
0x4ecb	0x98	Canis		Uhu, I'll make preparations before	
				long, so look forward to it, Nayuta♪	
0x4f69	0x98	Canis		Even Dr. Hydol cannot cure	
				Eartha's illness...	
0x4fb7	0x98	Canis		Ah, why has Eartha...	
				I'm overwhelmed.	
0x4ffd	0x98	Canis		...Anyway, for now,	
				all we can do is believe.	
0x5072	0x98	Canis		...Anyway, for now,	mp_0116 0x4ffd
				all we can do is believe.	
0x50bf	0x98	Canis		I'm sure a miracle will occur.	
				Cheer up, Nayuta.	
0x5145	0x98	Canis		You say Eartha collapsed!?	
				W-What is this...!?	
0x5193	0x98	Canis		...But, since Dr. Hydol	
				is here, there's no need	
				to worry.	
0x51ec	0x98	Canis		If it is the doctor,	
				I'm sure he'll be able	
				to help Eartha!	
0x526e	0x98	Canis		If Dr. Hydol is here, then	
				everything will be all right.	
0x52c6	0x98	Canis		Nayuta, it's no good for	
				your face to be so gloomy.	
0x534f	0x98	Canis		Cygna passed by the road in	
				front of our house just now.	
0x53a7	0x98	Canis		My father thought they could play together,	
				but it seems he paid no attention.	
				Somehow, I'm worried.	
0x542a	0x98	Canis		Because, it's the first time I've	
				seen Cygna's face in deep	
				thought.	
0x54b5	0x98	Canis		It's the first time I've	
				seen Cygna's face in deep	
				thought.	
0x550f	0x98	Canis		I wonder what in the world	
				could be wrong...	
0x5591	0x98	Canis		Oh my, what's wrong, Nayuta?	
0x55ce	0x98	Canis		Somehow, you look	
				super excited, but...	
0x5615	0x98	ALTO		H-Huh., it that so?	
0x5648	0x98	Canis		Ohoho, it is so.	
				Maybe you are exploring	
				that new ruin?	
0x569e	0x98	Canis		I think it is fine if you are	
				enjoying yourself, but take	
				care not to get hurt, OK?	
0x5710	0x98	ALTO		Y-Yes, understood.	
0x5742	0x98	ALTO		(Though Mrs. Janis is cheerful,	
				 sometimes she's sharp...)	
0x57d5	0x98	Canis		If you really find something dangerous	
				during your exploration of that ruin,	
				you should stop, but...	
0x5858	0x98	Canis		If you guys are enjoying yourself,	
				I think it's completely fine☆	
0x58b9	0x98	Canis		Be careful of injuries, OK?	
0x591d	0x98	Canis		If you guys are enjoying yourself,	
				I think exploration is completely fine☆	
0x5988	0x98	Canis		Be careful of injuries, OK?	mp_0116 0x58b9
0x59e0	0x98	Canis		Now, now, father...	
				It looks like your back has come	
				back with full force.	
0x5a49	0x98	Canis		Let me see, I'll carry	
				you to the bed.	
0x5ac3	0x98	Canis		My, Nayuta!!	
				Huhu, it looks like you've been well.	
0x5b15	0x98	ALTO		Haha, you look well too,

0x5b58	0x98	Canis		Ohohoho, that is my

0x5b9c	0x98	Canis		Ah, now that you and Cygna have

0x5c07	0x98	Canis		Huhu, before long, we'll have to

0x6309	0x98	Serpent		I've already requested the offerings	
				from various people on the island.	
0x6372	0x98	Serpent		I have called on the farmer, fisherman	
				and finally trader Antlia.	
0x63d5	0x98	Serpent		The success of the Star Festival	
				is on your shoulders!	
				Thank you for your help.	
0x651a	0x98	Serpent		As for the "Ruins Rock Salt,"	
				if you search the beach patiently,	
				you should be able to gather at least one.	
0x65a6	0x98	Serpent		Next, about the local cuisine that	
				was formerly popular on the island...	
				Hmm, whose specialty was that again?	
0x663e	0x98	Serpent		Another famous product of our	
				village is the "Ruins Rock Salt" crystals that	
				can be collected at the Remnant Island beach.	
0x66d9	0x98	Serpent		If you search the beach carefully, I'm sure you'll	
				find at least one.	
0x6740	0x98	Serpent		Next is this island's local	
				cuisine since antiquity...	
				It should be the specialty of someone in the village.	
0x67cd	0x98	Serpent		It's someone you normally wouldn't	
				think of as a cook...	
				Don't you have any ideas?	
quest_Canis					
0x692d	0x98	Canis		...In this conversation only,	
				I can represent my father～.	
0x6987	0x98	Canis		Except during medical exams,	
				I have been taking the medicine	
				in his place.	
0x69f0	0x98	Canis		Anyway,	
				thank you for telling me.	
				I'll make sure he does in the future.	
QS_24_ask_Serpent					
0x6c08	0x98	Serpent		Oh, Nayuta.	
				Are you searching for something?	
0x6c56	0x98	ALTO	#6A	There's something I want	
				to ask you, elder...	
0x6ca5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0x6ccf	0x98	ALTO	#6A	If I say this island's "famous products,"	
				what exactly comes to mind?	
0x6d36	0x98	Serpent		Why that out of the blue?	
				Is that a topic you need to	
				tackle during your summer vacation?	
0x6db0	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SURPRISE_WEAK	
0x6ddf	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Umm...	
				Well, I guess that's about it.	
0x6e26	0x98	ALTO	#6A	(I can't say something like,	
				 it's a request from someone in	
				 another world, can I...)	
0x6e9d	0x06	Serpent		ANI_NOD	
0x6ec5	0x98	Serpent		Hoho, is that so.	
				A thirst for knowledge is a good thing.	
0x6f20	0x98	Serpent		When I think of Remnant Island's famous	
				products, first I think of...	
				dried marine products, as you'd expect.	
0x6fae	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x6fd6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Dried marine products, huh...	
				Certainly, they're made at various locations	
				on the island.	
0x7050	0x98	Serpent		Now, the island is self-sufficient due	
				to fishing, hunting and agriculture	
				to provide our meals.	
0x70d1	0x98	Serpent		Long ago, there were many more	
				fish in the coastal waters than there	
				are now, and fishing was more popular.	
0x715d	0x98	Serpent		During that time,	
				dried fish food became	
				more popular, too.	
0x71b9	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x71de	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ehehe, I see...	
				So that was the history of	
				this island.	
0x7236	0x98	Serpent		...Hmm, that's right.	
				This is the perfect chance...	
0x728b	0x98	Serpent		I'll give you some of my	
				Remnant Island-made dried	
				fish snack reserve.

0x7460	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Wow, thank you very much.	
0x749c	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x74c6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Are there other Remnant Island	
				famous products besides that?	
0x7524	0x06	Serpent		ANI_NOD	
0x754c	0x98	Serpent		Yes, of course there are.	
0x7588	0x98	Serpent		One of them is "Ruins Rock Salt"	
				crystals that can be collected on	
				the Remnant Island beach.	
0x7605	0x98	Serpent		They are a product of natural	
				evaporation on the ruins	
				near the island.	
0x766d	0x98	Serpent		If you search the beach with perseverance,	
				you should be able to collect at least one.	
0x76e5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0x770a	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmmhmm...	
				I understand. I'll try searching for it.	
0x775e	0x98	Serpent		Next is this island's local	
				cuisine since antiquity...	
0x77b6	0x98	Serpent		...But I forgot the	
				name of the dish.

0x7859	0x06	Serpent		ANI_THINK	
0x7883	0x98	Serpent		I'm sure that it's the	
				specialty of someone in the village.	
0x78e0	0x98	Serpent		But, it's not Gruz the cook or	
				your sister Eartha...	
0x7936	0x98	Serpent		I think it's someone you wouldn't	
				ordinarily think of as a cook.	
0x7998	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0x79bf	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm...	
				It seems like I have no choice	
				but to go around asking.	
0x7a1e	0x06	Serpent		ANI_WAIT	
0x7a47	0x98	Serpent		Hmm, that's about	
				all I can help you with.	
0x7a93	0x98	Serpent		Do your best with your	
				summer vacation homework.	
0x7ae5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0x7b13	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Ah, ahaha...understood.

0x7e13	0x98	Canis		Oh, Nayuta.	
				Do you need something from me,	
				I wonder～?	
0x7e68	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x7e92	0x40	UNDEF		Explained about the medical exam	
				Dr. Hydol came to perform.	
0x7eed	0x06	Canis		ANI_GESTURE2

0x9085	0x98	NOI	#6A	Umm, about that...	
				What is the "Star Festival?"	
0x90ea	0x98	ALTO		It is a festival held on	
				Remnant Island once a year.	
0x9152	0x98	ALTO		Because the starry sky and shooting	
				stars are so beautiful on this island,	
				it is so named, it seems.	
0x91d4	0x98	ALTO		We do not work on this day,	
				and all celebrate together.	
0x922a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Ehe, it seems really fun!	
0x9265	0x98	Serpent		Yes, a great many tourists come

0x92fc	0x98	Serpent		Due to the abnormalities last year,

0x936a	0x98	Serpent		This festival is an important function

				and nature.	
0x93e7	0x98	Serpent		We absolutely must	
				hold the festival this year.	
0x9438	0x98	ALTO		That's right.

0x959d	0x98	Serpent		Yes, it is not such a large task.	
0x95e1	0x98	Serpent		As you know, we have a custom on the island

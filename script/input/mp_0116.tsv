0xba0	0x98	Serpent		With this, the preparations for the Star Festival	
				are almost done. Our ancestors of Remnant Island	
				will be pleased with this year's abundant harvest.	
0xc47	0x98	Serpent		Good job, Nayuta and the Great Fairy.	
				Allow me to thank you again.	
0xce1	0x98	Serpent		O Great Fairy...!	
0xd0e	0x98	Serpent		I thought I saw a blinding flash of light from	
				the cape heralding your return. I never thought	
				you would again grace us with your presence!	
0xd8d	0x98	NOI		Wh-What the...?	
0xdbe	0x98	ALTO		The elder seems to think Noi	
				is some sacred being, you see...	
0xe0a	0x98	Serpent		I hear this Great Fairy is different	
				from the one from before... 	
				Please, make yourself at home.	
0xe71	0x98	Serpent		All of us here at the island	
				are delighted to have you.	
0xec4	0x98	NOI		Th-Thank you...	
0xf2b	0x98	Serpent		As the Star Festival approaches,	
				it seems the Great Fairy has graced	
				us with her presence once again...!	
0xfa6	0x98	Serpent		Last year's was canceled due to the	
				abnormalities, so we must make this	
				year's even livelier than normal.	
0x104d	0x98	Serpent		Great Fairy, please, make yourself at home.	
0x108d	0x98	Serpent		All of us here at the island	mp_0116 0xe71
				are delighted to have you.	
0x1118	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, you work hard	
				every day with your	
				Handyman Shop work.	
0x1176	0x98	Serpent		You've been very helpful to	
				all of us here in the village.	
0x11ca	0x98	ALTO		Haha, that's my job.	
0x1209	0x98	ALTO		Elder, if you need any help,	
				feel free to ask anytime.	
0x1268	0x98	Serpent		Mmhmm, yes, that's a good idea.	
0x12a8	0x98	Serpent		This year's Star Festival is coming up...	
				I hope we can rely on you for your help.	
0x133c	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, you've been very helpful	
				to all of us here in the village.	
0x13ab	0x98	Serpent		This year's Star Festival is coming up...	mp_0116 0x12a8
				I hope we can rely on you for your help.	
0x144d	0x98	Serpent		The look of that moon...	
				No matter how much I see it, I always get	
				the feeling that the end times are near.	
0x14c3	0x98	Serpent		But as elder of Remnant Island, I have	
				a responsibility to ensure our future.	
0x1515	0x98	Serpent		Given my age, I don't have time	
				to get emotional about it... Anyway,	
				we must do what we can together.	
0x15c8	0x98	Serpent		As elder, I have a responsibility	
				to ensure our future.	
0x1615	0x98	Serpent		...For now anyway, we all	
				must do what we can.	
0x169b	0x98	Serpent		Before Master Orvus came to Remnant Island,	
				he had doubts on the meaning of 'strength.'	
0x1707	0x98	Serpent		Nowadays, we no longer live in a world where	
				you can be distinguished by brute power alone.	
				Is there any meaning left in his strength?	
0x17a1	0x98	Serpent		But, thanks to taking in Cygna,	
				it seems he has found the answer:	
				his strength is to protect.	
0x181f	0x98	Serpent		...It seems Cygna is missing...	
				I hope he is safe.	
0x189e	0x98	Serpent		Thanks to taking in Cygna, Master Orvus	
				seems to have found the answer to his	
				doubts: his strength is to protect.	
0x1922	0x98	Serpent		...It seems Cygna is missing...	mp_0116 0x181f
				I hope he is safe.	
0x19af	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, Great Fairy.	
				Please do not lose hope.	
0x19f8	0x98	Serpent		I'm sure that young Creha	
				is still safe somewhere...	
				The villagers all believe this too.	
0x1a79	0x98	Serpent		Anyway, for now, we must prepare	
				ourselves for the worse.	
0x1b06	0x98	Serpent		I'm sure that young Creha	mp_0116 0x19f8
				is still safe somewhere...	
				The villagers all believe this too.	
0x1b87	0x98	Serpent		Anyway, for now, we must prepare	mp_0116 0x1a79
				ourselves for the worse.	
0x1c22	0x98	Serpent		That young lady...	
				I told the villagers	
				she was kidnapped.	
0x1c81	0x98	Serpent		If I told them the truth, it would only	
				cause a panic, so I will hold off for now.	
0x1ce7	0x98	Serpent		...I'm afraid it's you I'm most worried	
				about. I can't believe you were involved	
				with Lost Heaven...	
0x1d63	0x98	Serpent		The missing paradise, Shangri-La... 	
				Though known by many names, it was	
				always thought to be fiction.	
0x1deb	0x98	Serpent		I can't believe you reached that place...	
				Can my heart take this stress?	
0x1e75	0x98	Serpent		I will leave the young	
				lady and Cygna to you.	
0x1ec7	0x98	Serpent		However... I am concerned about you, too.	
				Definitely make sure to return safely, okay?	
0x1f7d	0x98	Serpent		Just now, a young lady named	
				Creha came by to greet me.	
0x1fd6	0x98	Serpent		Goodness gracious,	
				such a lovely girl.	
0x201d	0x98	Serpent		Hohoho, even the pain in my	
				back somehow disappeared.	
0x209b	0x98	Serpent		That young lady Creha	
				is such a lovely girl.	
0x20d9	0x98	Serpent		Hohoho, even the pain in my	mp_0116 0x201d
				back somehow disappeared.	
0x2165	0x98	Serpent		Ow-ow-ow... Celebration is 	
				unbecoming of one my age.	
0x21bc	0x98	Serpent		H-However, you know...	
				It is good to hear that Eartha is cured.	
				There is no better news than this.	
0x2235	0x98	Serpent		I will have to crawl my way over	
				to visit her soon, so please give	
				her my regards until then.	
0x229f	0x98	ALTO		Um, please, take it easy...	
0x2308	0x98	Serpent		All it takes is one act of celebration	
				and now it's acting up like this...	
				My back doesn't make it easy...	
0x2389	0x98	Serpent		Well most importantly, it's good to hear that	
				Eartha is cured. I will go visit her soon, so	
				please give her my regards until then.	
0x2446	0x98	Serpent		...I'm very sorry, Nayuta.	
				I know of nothing else that can be	
				done regarding Eartha's illness.	
0x24a8	0x98	Serpent		I wish I knew of some folk	
				remedy that could help when	
				it comes to Hell Fever...	
0x251d	0x98	Serpent		The only thing I'm still good for is	
				the knowledge I've built up over the	
				years, and yet I feel so useless...	
0x25dd	0x98	Serpent		I know of nothing else that can be	
				done regarding Eartha's illness...	
0x2633	0x98	Serpent		The only thing I'm still good for is	mp_0116 0x251d
				the knowledge I've built up over the	
				years, and yet I feel so useless...	
0x2701	0x98	Serpent		I saw Dr. Hydrol	
				running over...	
0x2742	0x98	Serpent		Nayuta, is it true that	
				Eartha collapsed?	
0x278d	0x98	Serpent		I see... Then, that's not good.	
				If the doctor is here, there should	
				be nothing to worry about...	
0x2829	0x98	Serpent		I sure hope it is nothing serious...	
0x28a9	0x98	Serpent		It is said that long ago, 	
				a calamity occurred called	
				the Great Flood.	
0x290d	0x98	Serpent		In it, almost all the land was	
				submerged under the Ciencia Sea...	
0x296c	0x98	Serpent		Later on, as ruins fell in the sea,	
				this island of 'remnants' was made.	
0x29db	0x98	Serpent		That is how this island came	
				to be known as Remnant Island.	
				...Did you learn something?	
0x2a7b	0x98	Serpent		After the Great Flood, it is said that	
				falling ruins gradually created what	
				came to be known as Remnant Island.	
0x2b03	0x98	Serpent		Well, whether the Great Flood actually	
				occurred, no one knows for sure.	
0x2ba1	0x98	Serpent		The falling ruins... Though I've experienced	
				this phenomenon numerous times since my youth,	
				it remains as profoundly mysterious as ever.	
0x2c37	0x98	Serpent		It occurs two or three times a year	
				across all of the Ciencia Sea.	
0x2ca6	0x98	Serpent		Even the most renowned scientists have	
				never been able to fully explain it...	
0x2d14	0x98	ALTO		Oh yeah, I asked my professor at	
				Saint Cerise Academy about it...	
0x2d7e	0x98	ALTO		But right now, we have no	
				idea what causes it.	
0x2dd0	0x98	Serpent		Hmm, that's right. There are theories that	
				the star shards that also fall from the	
				sky have something to do with it...	
0x2e58	0x98	Serpent		I wonder if the day will come when some	
				researcher with a good head on his shoulders	
				will somehow explain this mystery.	
0x2ef9	0x98	ALTO		(...I would like to figure	
				 it out myself...)	
0x2f61	0x6B	Serpent		Surprise	
0x2f96	0x98	Serpent		Oh, right, I digress...	
				There are plans to start an unusual	
				establishment on this island soon.	
0x3020	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x3052	0x98	ALTO		'An unusual establishment'...?	
0x308a	0x98	Serpent		Yes, I was rather surprised myself	
				when I first heard about it.	
0x30e0	0x98	Serpent		It's located down near the harbor.	
				Nayuta, you should check it out	
				when you have time.	
0x318a	0x98	Serpent		There are plans to start an unusual	
				establishment on this island soon.	
0x31ec	0x98	Serpent		Though I'm told it will be a little	
				longer before it officially opens...	
				Hoho, I look forward to seeing it.	
0x3277	0x98	Serpent		Even my back is feeling	
				better than ever.	
0x32fb	0x98	Serpent		It seems it will be a little while	
				longer before it officially opens..	
0x3368	0x98	Serpent		Even my back is feeling	
				better than ever.	
				Hohoho...	
0x3404	0x98	Serpent		Th-That shaking just now...	
				My...my back... Gah...	
0x3453	0x98	Serpent		...N-Nayuta... I'm sorry, but...	
				now's not a good time...	
				I've thrown out my back...	
0x34e9	0x98	Serpent		...I-I'm sorry, but...	
				now's not a good time...	
				I've thrown out my back...	
0x358a	0x98	Serpent		Oh, Nayuta, it seems that you and	
				Cygna have returned to the island.	
0x35ea	0x98	ALTO		Yes, Elder, we're home.	
0x3629	0x98	Serpent		Hmm, yes, you are such a	
				polite young man, Nayuta.	
0x367b	0x98	Serpent		This must be all thanks to Eartha, who	
				practically raised you like a mother.	
				You have a lot to thank her for.	
0x36fc	0x98	Serpent		Hmm, you're 15 years old already...	
				Now that you've entered Saint Cerise Academy,	
				you can't keep playing as much as before.	
0x3787	0x98	Serpent		Study hard like I did when I was younger,	
				and I'm sure your future will be─	
0x3815	0x6B	Serpent		Exclamation

0x38a4	0x98	ALTO		E-Elder... Are you all right!?	
0x38e1	0x98	Serpent		Y-Yes, when I give passionate	
				lectures, my chronic back pain...	
0x3942	0x98	Serpent		A-Anyway, while you are in the	
				village, you should relax, yes?

				Hohoho, we'd better celebrate!	
0x3d0a	0x98	Canis		In fact, your Auntie Janis plans	
				to sponsor the eating contest for	
				the Star Festival this year.	
0x3d7c	0x98	Canis		We should eat and drink plenty

0x42a5	0x98	Canis		I'm sure it's because your Auntie is frail.

0x43e0	0x98	Canis		Under these circumstances, we

0x4461	0x98	Canis		We can't really afford to hold

0x44b1	0x98	Canis		*sigh*, what a pity. This year's

				from various people on the island.	
0x6372	0x98	Serpent		There's the farmer, the fisherman,	
				and finally, the trader Antlia.	
0x63d5	0x98	Serpent		The success of the Star Festival	
				rests on your shoulders!	
				Thank you for your help.	
0x651a	0x98	Serpent		If you carefully search the ruins by	
				the beach, you should be able to gather	
				some crystallized Ruins Rock Salt.	
0x65a6	0x98	Serpent		Now, about the local dish that used	
				to be popular on the island...	
				Hmm, whose specialty was that again?	
0x663e	0x98	Serpent		Another specialty of our village are	
				the crystals of Ruins Rock Salt that	
				are found on the Remnant Island beach.	
0x66d9	0x98	Serpent		If you search the ruins by the beach,	
				I'm sure you'll find some.	
0x6740	0x98	Serpent		Next is this island's old local dish...	
				Someone in the village was an expert at it.	
0x67cd	0x98	Serpent		It was someone you normally	
				wouldn't think of as a cook...	
				Do you have any ideas?

0x6f20	0x98	Serpent		For Remnant Island's specialties,	
				the first thing that comes to mind...	
				It has to be dried seafood.	
0x6fae	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2	
0x6fd6	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Dried seafood...?	
				It's certainly made in many	
				places throughout the village.	
0x7050	0x98	Serpent		Now, Remnant Island is mostly	
				self-sufficient due to its	
				fishing and agriculture...	
0x70d1	0x98	Serpent		In the olden days, there used to be	
				more fish in the waters around here,	
				so fishing was especially popular.	
0x715d	0x98	Serpent		They started to dry their fish in order to	
				prevent the wasting of their catches, and so	
				dried fish dishes became more popular, too.	
0x71b9	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0x71de	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Hmm, I see...

0x7524	0x06	Serpent		ANI_NOD	
0x754c	0x98	Serpent		Mhm, of course.	
0x7588	0x98	Serpent		One is Ruins Rock Salt. Their	
				crystals can be found on the	
				Remnant Island beach.	
0x7605	0x98	Serpent		They are a natural product of	
				the evaporation of seawater over	
				the ruins near the island.	
0x766d	0x98	Serpent		If you search the ruins by the beach,	mp_0116 0x66d9

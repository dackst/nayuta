0x32af7	0x98	NOI		A walk...?	
0x32b39	0x98	Asa	#6A	It's depressing to be stuck

0x32b8e	0x06	NOI		ANI_WAIT	
0x32bd3	0x98	Asa		Plus, I think everyone in

0x32c51	0x06	Asa		ANI_SIT1_GESTURE2	
0x32c7f	0x98	Asa		Lyra was worried sick about

0x32ced	0x06	ALTO_pj		ANI_SIT2_NOD	
0x32d1a	0x98	ALTO_pj	#6A	...Is that so? I guess

0x33feb	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SIT2_DENY	
0x34016	0x98	ALTO	#6A	No, actually, I think I still want

0x34080	0x98	ALTO	#6A	This shop is the biggest mark that Cygna

0x3458b	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x345b5	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, I'll hurry up

0x35199	0x98	NOI	#6A	Uh, umm, that's not why...	
0x351d7	0x98	NOI	#6A	To tell you the truth, I came

0x35247	0x98	ALTO		...A reason?	
0x3529a	0x98	NOI	#6A	...To bring someone to Terra.

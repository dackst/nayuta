0x2510	0x06	Cetus		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x253b	0x98	Cetus		She said something about "finding treasure"

0x2681	0x06	ALTO		ANI_THINK2

0x26f1	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x271a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Nayuta, I think we should

0x288f	0x98	Cetus		Well, in fact, Reticul has actually	
				been very lucky so far...		
0x290f	0x98	Cetus		She's always been able to slip away from

0x2ad7	0x06	Cetus		ANI_NOD	
0x2afd	0x98	Cetus		Yeah, about that...	
0x2b31	0x98	Cetus		Not much time has passed

0x4aeb	0x98	Reticul		...No, it's okay.

0x5208	0x98	Cetus		I'd love to show you my graditude,

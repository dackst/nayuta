0x2cca	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x2cfc	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0x2d2e	0x98	ALTO		A m-museum...!?	mp_0000 0x180b8
0x2d5a	0x98	ALTO		I'm pretty sure this is	
				an abandoned building	
				that no one lives in...	
0x2dcf	0x98	ALTO		No, there would never be any sort	
				of museum on Remnant Island...	
0x2e44	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x2e76	0x98	ALTO		...I got excited there for a moment.	
				Wonder what this poster is doing here.	
0x2edb	0x98	ALTO		Maybe it's someone's idea of a prank...	
0x2f40	0x98	ALTO		(If it's really a museum, then what for?	
				 Hmm, I'm really curious...)	
talk_Puppis
0x2fe7	0x98	Puppis		You've finally been starting	
				to feel like a full-fledged	
				sailor these days, Crux.	
0x3048	0x98	Puppis		I'm glad to have a new	
				junior sailor in my life.	
0x30a0	0x98	Puppis		...But it's disheartening to	
				see that you still can't swim.	
0x310a	0x98	Crux		You, you p-promised	
				not to say anything...	
0x317e	0x98	Puppis		You've finally been starting	mp_0003 0x2fe7
				to feel like a full-fledged
				sailor these days, Crux.
0x31df	0x98	Puppis		Feels like, before you even	
				realize it, people will grow	
				up before your very eyes.		
0x3291	0x98	Puppis		Holy smokes...	
0x32c7	0x98	Puppis		I knew Remnant Island	
				was mysterious...	
0x3320	0x98	Puppis		I never would have thought all	
				this other stuff besides the	
				ruins would rain down...	
0x33a3	0x98	Puppis		I knew Remnant Island	mp_0003 0x32c7
				was mysterious...
0x33fc	0x98	Puppis		I can't see a damn thing out	
				there. We should probably	
				delay our departure...	
0x3490	0x98	Puppis		...It's always a welcome	
				relief to come out here.	
0x34f2	0x98	Puppis		I'm always listening to	
				some pretty troubling	
				news in San Ceriz.	
0x3555	0x98	Puppis		They say a war is brewing in the	
				northern parts of the continent...	
0x35c0	0x98	Puppis		Gunfire has been a frequent	
				occurrence in that area for years... 
				What a sorry state of affairs. 	
0x364c	0x98	Puppis		They say a war is brewing in the	mp_0003 0x3555
				northern parts of the continent...
0x36b7	0x98	Puppis		I kinda envy you islanders, living	
				a peaceful life out here all on	
				your own on this small island...	
0x375f	0x98	Puppis		...Don't worry about Crux.	
				It was only a matter of time	
				before this problem would arise.
0x37f7	0x98	Puppis		Crux! Look alive!	
0x3846	0x98	Crux		Y-Yes, sir!	
0x3897	0x98	Puppis		Anyway, boy, I heard your	
				sister's feeling better now.	
0x38f6	0x98	Puppis		I was surprised to hear that	
				her Hell Fever was cured.	
0x3947	0x98	Puppis		It just goes to show that your	
				sister's a tough woman. Though	
				I'm sure the meds helped too.	
0x39f1	0x98	Puppis		There's an old sailor's	
				tale about Hell Fever.	
0x3a53	0x98	Puppis		If you keep sailing far out into	
				the ocean, you'll eventually	
				reach the End of the World...	
0x3ac5	0x98	Puppis		If you go near it,	
				you'll be struck with	
				a mysterious disease.	
0x3b1c	0x98	Puppis		...Well, actually, there's
				nothing at the End of the 	
				World but a huge storm.	
0x3bb6	0x98	Puppis		If you continue going southwest	
				on the Ciencia Sea, you would	
				end up at the End of the World.	
0x3c31	0x98	Puppis		But because of that huge storm,	
				nobody has ever seen the true End.	
0x3ce8	0x98	Puppis		Just when I was about to	
				set sail, a ruin fell?	
0x3d3b	0x98	Puppis		Maybe it's just because of	
				how large it was, but it	
				looked like it fell nearby.	
0x3d94	0x98	Puppis		Even though it happens several	
				times every year in the waters	
				around Remnant Island...	
0x3e0c	0x98	Puppis		It was pretty scary this time around.	
0x3e84	0x98	Puppis		That damn thing that fell... Even though	
				it's Remnant Island's signature product,	
				it was still pretty frightening.	
0x3f17	0x98	Puppis		I just hope that we don't run into this	
				sort of thing while out on a voyage.	
0x3fb4	0x98	Puppis		Hey, boy, so you're making	
				your greeting rounds.	
0x4004	0x98	Puppis		How was your return home?	
0x404a	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha, I still missed it,	
				even though I've only been	
				away for four months.
0x40b4	0x98	ALTO		I also wanted to thank you,	
				Captain. Letting me slide	
				on board was a big help.	
0x412a	0x98	Puppis		Gahaha, it's nothing. You should	
				at least be able to enjoy your	
				summer vacation at home.	
0x4194	0x98	Puppis		Though I'll be setting sail,	
				I'll be back here again soon.	
0x41eb	0x98	ALTO		Yes, understood.	
				Be careful on your journey.	
0x4273	0x98	Puppis		Care is always needed for	
				landings at Remnant Island.	
0x42c9	0x98	Puppis		The seabed around the island is full of	
				underwater ruins. If you're not careful,	
				you'll scrape the hull of your ship.	
0x4351	0x98	Puppis		Even though it's kind of a hassle,	
				stopping the ship and rowing ashore	
				on a smaller boat is the best method.	
0x43f7	0x98	Puppis		There's no way I would risk	
				damaging my precious ship.	
0x4445	0x98	Puppis		Care is always needed for	mp_0003 0x4273
				landings at Remnant Island.
talk_Crux
0x4529	0x98	Crux		I know there's still many	
				things I still need to learn.	
0x4575	0x98	Crux		But as long as the captain and	
				my shipmates believe in me,	
				I'll do my best no matter what.	
0x4602	0x98	Crux		You know, we had a rough time	
				last year, but we got through it.	
0x4673	0x98	Crux		One day, I'll travel all over the	
				Ciencia Sea like the captain and	
				be a real full-fledged sailor!	
0x470d	0x98	Crux		As long as the captain and	
				my shipmates believe in me,	
				I'll do my best no matter what.		
0x479a	0x98	Crux		One day, I'll travel all over the	mp_0003 0x4673
				Ciencia Sea like the captain and
				be a real full-fledged sailor!
0x485c	0x98	Crux		(*shiver*)	
				...What's happening?	
0x4895	0x98	Crux		It looks like white powder	
				is falling into the ocean.	
0x48e8	0x98	Crux		It can't be... It's snowing	
				in the Ciencia Sea!?	
0x4964	0x98	Crux		I-It's c-cold...	
				Or should I say,	
				I'm cold...	
0x49ae	0x98	Crux		There's no way this should	
				be happening in the middle	
				of the Ciencia Sea...	
				...Brr! Seriously, what's going on!?	
0x4a4c	0x98	Crux		The ship is leaving soon, so we've	
				got to load up the passengers.	
0x4ab9	0x98	Crux		...Oh man, it's going to be a	
				bad day today. I just want to	
				get this over with.	
0x4b42	0x98	Crux		*huff*, *huff*...	
				That brat, making
				ridiculous demands...	
0x4bbe	0x6B	ALTO		Question	
0x4bf0	0x98	ALTO		(Did something happen...?)	
0x4c7a	0x98	Crux		Hey, Captain, I'm sorry, sir...	
				Please don't tell anyone...	
0x4ce3	0x98	Puppis		Fall deep enough into the sea, and the	
				waters and sun become pitch black. You	
				can't even tell which way is up...	
0x4d64	0x98	Puppis		Next time you fall overboard,	
				it looks like it'll be the end	
				of the line for you, eh, Crux?	
0x4dc7	0x98	Crux		Huuuuuh!?	
				Don't s-scare	
				me like that!	
0x4e44	0x6B	Crux		Sweatdrop	
0x4e76	0x98	Crux		It might be dangerous	
				that I can't swim...	
0x4ec4	0x98	Crux		...I at least need to	
				practice floating...	
0x4f0f	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x4f91	0x98	Crux		*cough*, *cough*...	
				I got scared earlier and	
				fell into the water.	
0x4fed	0x98	Crux		If it weren't for the captain's help,	
				I don't know what would've happened...	
				Ooh, I'll follow you forever, Captain!	
0x5086	0x98	Puppis		...Crux, quit being an idiot	
				and learn to swim already.	
0x50e3	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x5157	0x98	Crux		*cough*, *cough*...	
				If it weren't for the captain's help,	
				I don't know what would've happened...	
0x51cc	0x98	Crux		Maybe I should practice	
				swimming more seriously.	
0x5245	0x98	Puppis		...Crux, I won't be	
				helping you out next	
				time, understand?	
0x5294	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x52c6	0x98	Crux		Huuuh!? I knew it,	
				I need to practice!!	
0x5360	0x98	Crux		Tch, you're a lucky guy...	
0x5399	0x98	ALTO		Wh-What's wrong, Crux?	
0x53de	0x98	Crux		I mean, you're on summer	
				vacation now, right?	
0x5438	0x98	Crux		Don't you get to fully enjoy your	
				youth with your beautiful sister	
				and childhood friend?	
0x54aa	0x98	Crux		Meanwhile, all I get to look forward to is 	
				a voyage on a filthy ship with the captain.	
				It's a little unfair, isn't it?	
0x552b	0x6B	ALTO		Sweatdrop	
0x55a3	0x98	Puppis		...Crux, if you want to leave this	
				ship so bad, I won't stop you.	
0x5611	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x5681	0x98	Crux		No, no, no, Captain!	
				It was a joke, a joke!	
0x56c5	0x98	ALTO		Haha... Good luck, Crux.	
0x576e	0x98	Crux		Tch, the captain could stand	
				to get a sense of humor.	
0x57d9	0x98	Puppis		Crux. Stop wasting time	
				and get back to work.	
0x5828	0x6B	Crux		Unknown	
0x587a	0x98	Crux		Y-Yes, sir!	
0x58ea	0x98	Crux		Sorry, another time, then.	
				If I don't keep up the work,	
				the captain will yell at us.	
talk_Camelope
0x598f	0x98	Camelope		...This is the Remnant	
				Island where she lives?
				Oh my, how pitiful...	
0x59e0	0x98	Camelope		That one of the esteemed House of	
				Camelope would run away and hide	
				on this hick island! Preposterous!	
0x5aa4	0x98	Camelope		Shall we return her to her	
				rightful home at once?	
0x5b26	0x98	Camelope		Oh my, how pitiful...	
				One of the esteemed House of Camelope	
				would hide out on this hick island.	
0x5bbd	0x98	Camelope		Let's return her to her	
				rightful home at once, huh?		
talk_Norma
0x5c31	0x98	Norma		Oh, my...	
0x5c5b	0x98	Norma		What is this white powder...?	
0x5ce2	0x98	Norma		Milady is already leading	
				a fine life in this village.	
0x5d3a	0x98	Norma		Is it really the right decision	
				to forcibly bring her back as	
				Mistress wants...?	
0x5dcc	0x98	Norma		I have no idea.	
0x5e23	0x98	Norma		Is it really the right decision	
				to forcibly bring Milady back...?
0x5ebb	0x98	Norma		Mistress...	
				The inhabitants of the	
				island will hear you...	
0x5f28	0x98	Camelope		Shut up, Norma.	
				We're going.	
0x5f69	0x6B	Norma		Unknown	
0x5f9c	0x98	Norma		Y-Yes...	
0x5ffd	0x98	Norma		(Milady...	
				 I hope you are well.)	
0x6032	0x98	Norma		(Ooh, I'm sure you'll be	
				 upset to find out I'm	
				 here with Mistress...)	
talk_Axe
0x60dc	0x98	Axe		Nayuta, you out sticking your	
				nose into things again?	
0x613b	0x98	Axe		Well, don't do anything too	
				rash because Noi returned.	
0x6194	0x98	Axe		Don't forget about everyone else	
				waiting for you to come back.	
0x621f	0x98	Axe		Well, don't do anything too	mp_0003 0x613b
				rash because Noi returned.
0x6278	0x98	Axe		Don't forget about everyone else	mp_0003 0x6194
				waiting for you to come back.
0x6311	0x98	Axe		Brr... This weird powder suddenly	
				started falling from the sky.	
0x635f	0x98	Axe		And what's worse, it's gotten cold...	
				Shit, man, what is going on?	
0x63e7	0x98	Axe		It'll be hard to catch anything	
				in this cold weather...	
				No, I'll figure something out.	
0x644e	0x98	Axe		As if a man of the sea would	
				lose against some cold, dammit.	
0x650a	0x98	Axe		Huh, Eartha...?	
				I'm worried about her...	
0x6553	0x98	Axe		So, do you and Cygna go out	
				looking for herbs...?	
0x65ad	0x98	Axe		Wh-What? Cygna isn't with you?	
0x65e9	0x98	Axe		I don't really understand,	
				but good luck, anyway.	
				I'll go and visit her later.	
0x6677	0x98	Axe		Your depression is understandable.	
				You are close siblings, after all...	
0x66e0	0x98	Axe		But what is Cygna doing being	
				gone at a time like this...?	
0x676f	0x98	Axe		That reminds me, there's been some	
				people calling themselves researchers	
				showing up on the island recently.	
0x67ea	0x98	Axe		It's been around three months...	
				I see them around here all the time.	
0x684d	0x98	Axe		They said they were getting ready	
				for something... They're a strange	
				bunch, no matter how you look at it.	
0x68fe	0x98	Axe		It's been around three months...	
				Some researchers have been coming

				Ha, it's been a while.	
0x6a7c	0x98	ALTO		Ax...! You just got back	
				from fishing just now, huh?	
0x6ace	0x98	ALTO		A huge ruin fell at the cape on the	
				other side of the island earlier...	
				Are you all right?	
0x6b3c	0x98	Axe		Yeah, the waves became rough	
				and almost capsized my boat...	
0x6b9c	0x98	Axe		But, somehow, I managed to	
				keep it upright by sheer will.	
0x6bf4	0x98	ALTO		Haha, you're pretty tough.	
0x6c34	0x98	Axe		Yeah, Carina and the kids are	
				waiting for me at home.	
				I can't lose to some waves.	
0x6ca6	0x98	Axe		Say, are you going to	
				the fallen ruins, Nayuta?	
0x6cf9	0x98	Axe		You and Cygna can't keep

				this all the time.		
0x6d40	0x98	ALTO		Yeah, I know! ♪	
0x6d6e	0x98	Axe		Oh man... I can't convince you of

0x6e19	0x98	Axe		Though I WAS a little scared back there,

0x7081	0x98	Carina		Hehe, it kinda reminded me

0x83b1	0x98	Bell		To Vel, Noi is Noi.

0x8496	0x98	Bell		To Vel, Noi is Noi.	mp_0003 0x83b1

0x86b7	0x98	Bell		Mom and Dad went to work.	
0x86f8	0x98	Bell		Even though I'm lonely, it's work...	
				It can't be helped...	
0x8754	0x98	Bell		...At times like this, big brother	
				Cygna would always play with me...	
0x87e7	0x98	Bell		...Vel won't cry.	
0x8818	0x98	Bell		Right, Lyra is looking

				I gotta see her later!	
0x88be	0x98	Bell		Ehehe. Today, Vel will

0x890b	0x98	ALTO		Oh, is that so...?	
				Heh, that doesn't

0x894b	0x98	Bell		Hmph, I don't care what you

0x89be	0x98	Bell		Hey, Cory, something's floating

0x8a78	0x98	Bell		Yes, correct!!

0x8b7e	0x98	Bell		Hey, Cory, what's that stuff

0x907e	0x98	Hydol		Will the ship leave in these conditions?	
				I'm getting concerned...	
0x9120	0x98	Hydol		Hey, Nayuta.	
0x914d	0x98	Hydol		Now that I've confirmed Eartha's

				I returned to the Medical Clinic.	
0x91d1	0x98	Hydol		Haha, since I've stayed here for

0x9282	0x98	Hydol		Though there's still some time until we

0x98fa	0x98	Antlia		In the North Sea, the snow blocks

0x9977	0x98	Antlia		Never had I thought that I would

0x99fb	0x98	Antlia		I never thought that I would

				...Sorry, I forgot.	
0xa0db	0x3F	Name		Youth with Rucksack	
0xa0f6	0x98	Cetus		They say Remnant Island was

talk_Vavo
0xa4f0	0x98	Vavo		There is a legend that on the	
				other side of the End of the	
				World is a never-ending "Hell."	
0xa55f	0x98	Vavo		Since it mainly only affects the northern reaches	
				of the continent, which is close to the End, the	
				disease was named "Hell Fever," but...	
0xa5f0	0x98	Vavo		...As a matter of fact, there have been	
				recent reports that the "End" has been	
				gradually expanding towards this island...		
0xa672	0x98	Vavo		It may be no mere coincidence	
				that a new case of Hell Fever	
				showed up here...	
0xa70b	0x98	Vavo		Hell Fever showed up here...	
0xa768	0x98	Vavo		It may be no mere coincidence	
				that the End of the World is	
				rumored to be approaching...	
0xa80a	0x98	Vavo		Oh, do you need something	
				from Professor Volans?	
0xa84f	0x98	Vavo		As always, you can find	
				him inside the museum,	
				absorbed in his research.	
0xa8d3	0x98	Vavo		Professor Volans' research often	
				goes beyond the fields of just	
				human and natural history.	
0xa94f	0x98	Vavo		His ideas are strange, but	
				very thought-provoking.	
0xa99c	0x98	Vavo		You might want to talk with

				further your own studies.	
0xaa1e	0x98	Vavo		Professor Volans' ideas are strange,

0xab74	0x98	ALTO		So, umm... It looks like

0xabc3	0x98	Creha		Yes... I am taking

0xac05	0x98	Creha		...He's so warm...

0xad80	0x98	ALTO		Anyway, just stay healthy,	
				and don't overdo it.	
0xadd1	0x98	ALTO		If you collapsed, Eartha,	
				Noi and I would all be	
				worried about you...	
0xae34	0x98	Creha		...Understood.	
				I'll be careful.	
0xae9b	0x98	Creha		Babies are strange...	
0xaed1	0x98	Creha		Just by being like this,

0xb1e3	0x98	Lyra		...Oh, nothing. I just

0xb281	0x98	Lyra		But still, I can't believe

				to hold a baby...	
0xb2d7	0x98	Lyra		Hmm... Is she the daughter of some	
				kind of noble? But somehow I feel

0xb34f	0x98	ALTO		Ahaha... Lyra, I don't

0xb3aa	0x98	Lyra		...Shut up, Nayuta.

				been something I've wanted to do for some time...	
				But of course, I'm a bit late to the party.	
0xb669	0x98	Cetus		Well, that we met here must be fate.	
				I've got to say hi to Uncle, too.	
0xb705	0x98	Cetus		Yo, Nayuta and Noi. It's been a long	
				time since we've last seen you guys.	
0xb757	0x98	ALTO		Cetus...! It's been a while.	
0xb78e	0x98	ALTO		I heard that you've been traveling

0xb801	0x98	Cetus		Yeah, we've traveled all throughout

				and the eastern islands.	
0xb869	0x98	Cetus		Reticul's become a bona fide adventurer.	
				Though she still acts the same as ever,	
				she's gained some skills.	
0xb8f6	0x98	NOI		An adventurer, huh...?	
				I would love that.	
0xb936	0x98	Cetus		Haha, if you'd like, you	
				should just go on another	
				adventure with Nayuta.	
0xb996	0x98	Cetus		I'm sure you two would	
				make great adventurers.	
0xba46	0x98	Cetus		After enjoying this break on Remnant

				beyond the End of the World...	
0xbac0	0x98	Cetus		What appeared beyond the End of

0xbb42	0x98	Cetus		Why don't you try becoming	
				an adventurer too one day,	
				Nayuta? It might suit you.	
0xbbd7	0x98	Cetus		What appeared beyond the End of	mp_0003 0xbac0

				No matter how you look at it,

0xc766	0x98	Aquela		...Heheh, excellent.

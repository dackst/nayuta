0x770b	0x98	Norma		Hehe, it's just like the

0x7774	0x98	Norma		The Mistress was very regretful of her decision

0x780d	0x98	Norma		So now she wants to spend as

0x7c01	0x98	Norma		Ooh... It is indeed scary.	
0x7c3f	0x98	Norma		But it's very admirable to see Milady	
				trying to keep the store open for the	
				people of the island...	
0x7cdf	0x98	Norma		I think Lady Sasha has	
				become a fine woman.	
0x7d4a	0x98	Norma		Though it's gradual, the Mistress

0xb434	0x98	Sasha		I'm worried about Norma,	mp_0113 0x8145
				and I'd like to make up
				for her if I could...
0xb48d	0x06	ALTO		ANI_WAIT4	
0xb4b4	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I'm hearing a lot of

0xb724	0x40	UNDEF		Afterwards, Nayuta headed for the general store	
				and placed the incense in an inconspicuous spot.	
0xb918	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xb942	0x98	ALTO	#6A	...That should do it.	
0xb9be	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT0	
0xb9e6	0x98	Sasha		Oh, it smells so good! It's like	
				taking a stroll through the woods...	
0xba63	0x98	Sasha		But... every attempt at making	
				up with Grandmother has failed	
				until now, you know?	
0xbaeb	0x98	Sasha		It's only incense. I wonder	
				if this will really work.	
0xbba9	0x06	Norma		ANI_COMPLAIN	
0xbbd4	0x98	Norma		I-I'm sure it will go well, Milady!	
0xbc17	0x06	Norma		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0xbc42	0x98	Norma		Mistress seems to want to	
				reconcile with you too...	
				Everything will be fine!	
0xbcc1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xbceb	0x98	ALTO	#6A	With this incense burning, you should	
				be able to have a calm conversation	
				without getting so heated.	
0xbd7a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_JOY	
0xbd9f	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I'll go hide.	
				Good luck, Sasha!	
0xbde5	0x06	Sasha		ANI_NOD	
0xbe0b	0x98	Sasha		W-Well...	
				Okay, Nayuta.	
0xbe90	0x6B	ALTO		Surprise	
0xbee0	0x6B	Sasha		Surprise	
0xbf32	0x6B	Norma		Surprise	
0xbfd9	0x98	Norma		Ah... It looks like

0xc066	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT2	
0xc0da	0x6B	ALTO		Unknown	
0xc3c6	0x98	Camelope	#6A	...I'm coming in.	
0xc3fe	0x06	Sasha		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xc429	0x98	Sasha		...Welcooome.	
0xc5e0	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT2	
0xc608	0x98	Norma		W-We have been expecting	
				you, Mistress.	
0xc66a	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Norma, you suddenly summon me to 	
				this place without my permission...	
				What is the meaning of this?	
0xc718	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Could it be that this tomboy here has	
				finally decided to go through with	
				the arranged marriage proposal?	
0xc78b	0x06	Camelope		ANI_WAIT4	
0xc7b6	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Yes, of course, it's much preferable to	
				live in elegance at the Camelope mansion	
				rather than this general store here.
0xc853	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT3	
0xc87b	0x98	Sasha		Hmph.	
0xc8a0	0x06	Norma		ANI_DENY	
0xc8c7	0x98	Norma		N-No, you see, today, I...	
0xc900	0x06	Sasha		ANI_LAUGH	
0xc928	0x98	Sasha		...Heh, oh, Grandmother. You should	
				keep your jokes to a minimum.	
0xc9aa	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT2	
0xc9d2	0x98	Sasha		At least I'm capable of finding my own lover.	
				I told you so the other day, but perhaps you	
				have forgotten already?	
0xca57	0x98	Sasha		You are getting up in your	
				years, after all. Ohohoho...	
0xca96	0x06	Camelope		ANI_WAIT3	
0xcac1	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Hmph.	
0xcaed	0x6B	Norma		Unknown

0xcba0	0x06	Norma		ANI_DEJECTED

0xcc9a	0x6B	Norma		Question

0xcd34	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT

0xcd8e	0x98	Camelope	#6A	...Hmph, well, whatever.	
0xcdcc	0x06	Camelope		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xcdfa	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Somehow, I'm not so bothered by	
				your flippant comments today.	
0xce57	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Why don't we both try to sort out	
				one thing we're frustrated about.		
0xceb7	0x06	Sasha		ANI_NOD	
0xcedd	0x98	Sasha		Hehe, okay. I was just thinking	
				of doing the same thing.	
0xcf51	0x98	Norma		(...That incense Master Nayuta brought...	
				 It certainly seems effective...)	
0xd00c	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT0	
0xd04f	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT0	
0xd092	0x06	Camelope		ANI_WAIT0	
0xd0d1	0x40	UNDEF		Within the calming air of the incense,	
				Sasha and Mrs. Camelope slowly launched	
				into a long conversation.	
0xd154	0x40	UNDEF		Sasha's desire for a life of freedom, and the	
				Mistress' desire to protect her family heritage...	
				The two things that kept the two of them apart...	
0xd1fd	0x40	UNDEF		They were both determined to understand each	
				other's point of view, which they had been	
				unable to express to each other for years.
0xd2ca	0x06	Camelope		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xd2f8	0x98	Camelope	#6A	...Then, I shall	
				excuse myself here.	
0xd341	0x06	Camelope		ANI_WAIT2	
0xd36c	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Hehe, Sasha... It was nice	
				speaking with you today.	
0xd3cc	0x06	Sasha		ANI_NOD	
0xd3f2	0x98	Sasha		I feel the same, Grandmother.	
0xd430	0x06	Sasha		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xd45b	0x98	Sasha		Please, by all means, try coming	
				here as a customer tomorrow.	
0xd4b8	0x06	Camelope		ANI_NOD	
0xd4e1	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Hehe, I think I will.	
0xd51d	0x06	Camelope		ANI_DIRECT	
0xd549	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Us Camelopes are a great merchant house to 	
				begin with. If you turn out to be managing some	
				half-assed establishment, I won't forgive you.	
0xd5fd	0x98	Camelope	#6A	Oh, Norma. It has been a long	
				time since we began our talk,	
				and I'm a little burned out.	
0xd66e	0x98	Camelope	#6A	I will be returning to the inn.	
				You are welcome to take your	
				time in returning.	
0xd6dd	0x06	Norma		ANI_NOD	
0xd703	0x98	Norma		Y-Yes, Mistress!	
0xda26	0x3F	Name		Nayuta's Voice	mp_0001 0x1090f
0xda3c	0x98	ALTO	#N	It sounds like you managed	
				to make it work.	
0xda91	0x6B	Sasha		Surprise	
0xdac4	0x6B	Norma		Surprise	
0xddba	0x06	Sasha		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xdde5	0x98	Sasha		Ah, Nayuta. So you were	
				out on the balcony?	
0xde3a	0x06	ALTO		ANI_SCRATCH_HEAD	
0xde68	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Haha, it definitely didn't seem	
				to be a conversation I should be	
				sticking my nose into.		
0xdee1	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE1	
0xdf0b	0x98	ALTO	#6A	So what ended up happening?	
				You started out talking about	
				the arranged marriage...	
0xdf80	0x06	Sasha		ANI_DENY	
0xdfa7	0x98	Sasha		Hehe, that's no longer a problem.	
				I told her I didn't want to, and	
				she seems to have understood.	
0xe02f	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT3	
0xe057	0x98	Sasha		She'll let me keep running the	
				general store if I show up and	
				visit my parents once in a while.	
0xe0da	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT2	
0xe102	0x98	Norma		From the start, Lady Sasha's parents...	
				The Master and his wife have forgiven	
				her from the very beginning.	
0xe183	0x06	Norma		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xe1ae	0x98	Norma		However, Mistress Camelope felt	
				that Milady was neglecting the	
				House, and ignored them...	
0xe22c	0x98	ALTO	#6A	I see...	mp_0001 0xcecd
0xe25c	0x06	Sasha		ANI_LAUGH	
0xe284	0x98	Sasha		Heh, it wasn't such a big deal	
				once we discussed it properly.	
0xe2f9	0x06	Sasha		ANI_WAIT0	
0xe321	0x98	Sasha		I should have faced her properly before	
				running away from the mansion...	
				I guess I was still just a kid.	
0xe3a9	0x06	Sasha		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xe3d4	0x98	Sasha		Well, thanks to that, I was able to	
				meet Nayuta and everyone else on	
				Remnant Island. I have no regrets.	
0xe469	0x06	Norma		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xe494	0x98	Norma		I am glad to see that Milady and	
				the Mistress have finally come to	
				an understanding with each other.	
0xe52a	0x98	Norma		Master Nayuta, truly, I thank you dearly.

0xe783	0x06	Norma		ANI_NOD	
0xe7a9	0x98	Norma		Yes, it is a small token	
				of my appreciation.	
0xe7f1	0x06	Sasha		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xe81c	0x98	Sasha		You deserve something for what	
				you did, so please, take it.	
0xe885	0x98	ALTO	#6A	Then, I'll accept it	
				without reservation.	
0xe8d0	0x06	Norma		ANI_WAIT2	
0xe8f8	0x98	Norma		Well, allow me to

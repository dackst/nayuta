0x50f	0x98	ALTO	#0W	Kureha...I wonder if she's all right.	
0x55f	0x98	NOI	#6A	...For now, all we can do is believe in her.	
0x5ad	0x98	NOI	#6A	If I think even for an instant that	
				Zext is Master Kureha's father...	
				I don't think he'll do anything to hurt her.

0x66f	0x98	ALTO	#1W	...............	mp_0001 0xc917
0x6a9	0x6B	NOI		Surprise	
0x70a	0x98	NOI	#6A	Nayuta...?	
0x753	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0x77d	0x98	ALTO		No...If I think about it,	
				I think it's pretty strange.	
0x7d2	0x98	ALTO		From the start, why did Zext	
				appear on <Terra> again, I wonder.	
0x894	0x40	ALTO		Kureha showed us the "Ancient Memories"...	
0x8de	0x40	ALTO		In that picture, he certainly	
				should have breathed his last.	
0x941	0x40	NOI		C-Certainly...	
0x96e	0x40	NOI		And...I feel that the personality of	
				the current Zext is too cruel.	
0x9cf	0x40	NOI		Even though I heard from Master Kureha	
				that he was a very kind person...	
0xaa9	0x98	NOI	#6A	But, ever since Master Kureha	
				followed Zext for the	
				mission of the <Mythos>...	
0xb17	0x98	NOI	#6A	There should be no mistake	
				that he is the real one.	
0xb73	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GESTURE2	
0xb9d	0x98	ALTO		...Anyway,	
				It seems all we can do	
				is check that directly.	
0xbfc	0x06	NOI		ANI_NOD	
0xc20	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah!	mp_0001 0x1174e
0xc85	0x98	NOI	#6A	Deep inside here, there's	
				a <Planetarium>, a crystallization	
				of Power of Stars.	
0xcf4	0x98	NOI	#6A	Zext plans to use it	
				to execute the <Remaking>...	
0xd4e	0x06	ALTO		ANI_NOD	
0xd73	0x98	ALTO		Before then, we'll do whatever	
				we can to reach him.	
0xdc5	0x06	ALTO		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0xdef	0x98	ALTO		This is probably the final battle...	
				Let's brace ourselves and go!	
0xe58	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0xe81	0x98	NOI	#6A	Yeah...	
				Let's do this!	
0x1257	0xCE	Objective		Kureha and Cygna are in the lower stratum. Let's hurry!

0x61b	0x98	Gio		Gwahaha... It seems that I, too,	
				am tempted to make a gamble...	
0x66b	0x98	Gio		Lady Creha and the other	
				Mitos were the ones that	
				gave me the role of Warden...	
0x6ba	0x98	Gio		You must be strong-willed	
				enough to be able to overcome	
				their sense of righteousness.
0x716	0x98	Gio		Though I cannot help you directly,	
				I leave everything in your care.		
0x7bd	0x98	Gio		And so, I choose to	
				cast my lot in with you.	
0x803	0x98	Gio		Though I cannot help you directly,	mp_6303 0x716
				I will entrust you with everything.	
				...I leave the rest to you.

0x4b16	0x06	Gio		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x4b81	0x98	Gio		The proud duty of the

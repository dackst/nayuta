0x1244	0x98	ALTO	#0x#500y	...The flowers are glowing somehow.	
0x12a3	0x98	NOI	#500x#500y	Those white flowers are a species

0x1b03	0x06	NOI		ANI_GOODIDEA

0x1bd5	0x98	ALTO		Underground...!?	
0x1c9e	0x40	NOI		What we have been exploring up until

0x1d00	0x40	NOI		That is, where the plants and animals

0x1eb1	0x40	NOI		This is the lower stratumâ”€

0x1f04	0x40	NOI		A residential district the

0x1f55	0x40	ALTO		Star Capital... Lexendria...	
0x1f98	0x40	NOI		It's supposedly named after

0x1fe8	0x40	NOI		There are four "Pillars" here

0x2859	0x98	NOI	#6A	In order for anyone other than a

0x2938	0x06	NOI		ANI_GESTURE1	
0x2961	0x98	NOI	#6A	They're the counterparts

0x29bf	0x98	NOI	#6A	If we put them in the

0x2a21	0x06	NOI		ANI_GUTSPOSE	
0x2a4a	0x98	NOI	#6A	They should be hidden in

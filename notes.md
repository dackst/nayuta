## Original Translation Problems ##

I've seen a lot of people on the internet say they had no problems with the original translation. Well, good for them, but as a native English speaker playing through the game for the first time with no prior knowledge of it, I thought there were lots of problems. 

In this section I list just some of the things that stuck out to me while playing it:


* "Even so", "though", etc. are commonly used as filler or conjunctions in situations
where they don't make sense in English
* "As expected" when it didn't seem reasonable for exactly that to be expected
* "somehow" and "anyhow" to express uncertainty, even if it is known exactly how
* use of "various" to mean "lots of things" rather than "lots of different things" 
* *most* of the original Japanese punctuation and sentence structure was preserved
  * questions that lack question marks. This doesn't happen in English, does it.
  * speaking of strange syntax, there is much use of it.
  * ..........everyone uses...so much...ellipsis........
    * ...................
    * ...................
    * I never paid attention to this before, spaces are typically put after ellipses, like... this. Japanese simply has no spaces.
  * "quotes" and \<brackets\> and Capitalization for terms specific to the story 
  * for no apparent  

    reason, line breaks mid sentence, resulting in lines of varying length in one text box
    * Perhaps...
    * ──it's for more action-y emphasis──
    * or more likely, the original translators translated line by line, and most of them cba to add/remove/rearrange lines and adjust the formatting
  * special symbols are used in place of punctuation☆, ♪, etc.) 
  * "but" is used as a conjunction between two independent clauses but, it's punctuated like this.
* Every non-impolite request/command is prefixed with a "please"
* Parenthetical remarks explaining Japanese puns, e.g. '(In Japanese, 39 -> "san-kyuu" -> "Thanks!")'




### awkward or overused words/phrases 

Here's a nonexhaustive list of suggestions for possible (i.e. not always done) rewording of overused or strangely-used phrases in the original translation. These aren't the only phrases, and the replacements aren't the only ones I used. It was really just made more for my own benefit while I was editing, as I would often come up with something, and then forget it later.

* as expected: after all, still, of course
* somehow: managed to, able to, feel, kind of, sort of
* that is...: is that..., what is that?
  * what in the world is that: "what is that?", but with more emotion/confusion, e.g. what the hell is that, what even is that, just what is that 
* the place/the location: where/there
  * this place/location: here
  * a place like this: such a place, all the way here
* that girl: she
* from now on: continue to, in the future
* with this: now
* I've got to x: I gotta, I've GOT to, I have to, I need to, I should
* thank goodness: (that's) great/good, what a relief, (maybe thank the gods or thank the stars for a wooleyism?)
* brace yourself: look alive, get ready, stay vigilant, stay focused
* do your best: good luck, give it all you've got, best of luck to you, fare thee well, have a good time, try your hardest
* unthinkable: ridiculous
* good grief: jeez, come on, man, for crying out loud
* let's hurry: hurry up, c'mon, come on, let's go, as soon as possible, 
* immediately: right away, get right to work, at once, as soon as possible
* anyway, anyhow: at any rate, in any case, either way, regardless
* is that so: I see, is that right, oh really
* leave/entrust the rest to you: it's all up to you, you can take care of this, you can handle this, i'll let you do this, you can do this, we're counting on you
* thank you very much: thank you so much (less formal/businesslike/sarcastic sounding), thank you, thanks, appreciate it, much appreciated, many thanks
* wait for me: hang on, stay right there, sit tight, hold on
* definitely, absolutely: for sure
* it can't be: no way, oh no
* it can't be helped: understandable, nothing can be done, no choice, can't help but, it's no use
* i heard: i hear, i'm told, they say, x said, x told me
* it seems: i heard, x seems to be, looks like, apparently
* it would be good: i hope, i wish, it would be a good idea, i pray
* i look forward to it: i'll hold you to it, sounds like a plan
* fixed: certain, specific

* remote/country/backcountry:  boonies, hick, rural, small town
  * not "country", they're literally on a tiny island with barely any land
* this side/other side: this world/other world (this isn't some Persona 1/2 alternate version of the same world kind of deal, and the characters who tend to use this phrasing already know that. you can't say they're referring to "this side of the gate", as these characters aren't limited to only use that one gate like nayuta is)
* trainings -> lesson, training session 

* fulfill mission: perform duties, complete plan
  * abandon: relinquish, ignore
* attitude/will: willpower, determination, confidence, courage
  * (when lacking): wishy-washy, banal, trite, weak, no confidence
* functions -> systems, functionality, features
* presence -> (life) signature 
* observing -> gazing (looking at stars, star shards, etc)
* nature -> environment, ecosystem, wildlife

---

In summary, there seemed to be almost consistent translation of [Japanese stock phrases](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StockJapanesePhrases?from=UsefulNotes.JapaneseStockPhrases) to English phrase, even in situations where that particular translation wouldn't make sense in English. 

In my edit, many of the out of place words/phrasings are replaced with something I believe to be more appropriate and sound more natural in English. Reformatting sentences was also done throughout.


### fixed inconsistencies

Despite the surprising consistency of little things mentioned above, it seems the original translators just couldn't decide how to phrase other things consistently that should be. 

Like before, this section mostly served so that *I* could keep these things consistent.

* inconsistent capitalization, esp. for special terms that are originally always used in "quotes" or 《brackets》 in Japanese:
  * should now be always capitalized
    * proper names: Garden (specific location), contintental epithets (Forest Continent, etc.), the End of the World/End (a specific location/border)
    * items that appear in your inventory
  * should now be always decapitalized (outside of dungeon names, etc.): 
    * "arts", "crafts", "mira", "star shard", "shard", "shining stone", "selge", "ruins", "temple", "warden", season names (spring, summer, autumn, winter), "seal", "final key", "key"
  * names of positions/titles (elder, doctor) should now be decapitalized, and only capitalized if used in place or as part of a name, e.g. "Hello, Elder", "go see the elder", and "Elder Serpent"

* inconsistent location names
  * Sacred Mountain Continent -> Holy Mountain Continent (so as to match up with the world map graphic)
  * Heavenly Mountain/Sacred Mountain/Sacred Mountain that Pierces Heaven -> Heavenly Mountain
  * Underworld Crater/Hell Crater/The Crater to the Underworld/Crater -> Infernal Crater
  * Center Planetarium/Planetarium Core -> Planetarium Core
  * Stellar Core Temple/Star Core Temple -> Planetary Core Temple
  * Star Capital/Stellar City -> <del>Star City</del> Star Capital
    * world map graphic has "Star Capital", might as well go with that
  * removed current season indicators in some world map dungeon names (sometimes they were in English, other times in still in Japanese, but mostly they were already absent)
    * it doesn't fit on-screen to add them all in English, plus there are multiple graphical indicators of the current season anyway

* inconsistent quest names
  * quest names in system dialogue should actually match up to the names in the quest log, and shouldn't change between being accepted and completed

* fix quotes/flashbacks/references to earlier scenes in different locations being worded differently
* fixed some offscreen voices being misidentified
  * Cygna was misidentfied under "Noi's Voice"
  * Orvus's voice should now always be "Dignified Voice"

* standardize inconsistent spellings of words
  * both all right and alright are used, like, a lot
    * standardized spelling to "all right", and tried to use alternatives more (e.g. okay) so it doesn't sound so overused
  * "awhile" and "a while"
    * "awhile" also seems to be used incorrectly *almost* every time it's originally used (i.e. not as an adverb equivalent to "for a while")
  * Jeez/Geez -> Jeez
* remove British English spellings (mould, enquire, traveller)
* standardized sound effect punctuation (the original Japanese appears to have none)
  * all actual sounds or things that produce a sound should now be \*sound*, while non-sounds should have parenthesis, e.g., (\*stare*), (\*nod*)
* standardized sound effect words
  * "Fufu" (フフ) was translated as all kinds of different things (mostly "Huhu", but also "Fufu", "Haha" or "Hehe"), "Fufu" should now typically be something like "Hehe" or "Heheh"
  * crying sounds should now be \*sniff*, rather than \*cry* or \*Tear*
  * drunk sounds should be \*hic*, and not crying sounds
  * \*pant*/\*huff* -> \*huff*
* standardized inconsistent system messages
  * quests: Quest [Quest Name] started!, Quest [Quest Name] completed!
  * Defeated high-rank monster [Monster Name]!
  * Noi recovered the *season name* magic, 『*magic name*』!
  * season unlock message
  * sub menu/submenu/sub-menu -> submenu

* rephrase "the/this [continent name] continent" and "Continent [continent name]" (as in, "Let's try to get to the Asia continent from Continent Europe!") or to either "the continent of [continent name]" or just "[continent name]" 
  * "[epithet] Continent [continent name]" is okay too i guess
  * "this [continent name] continent" might still make sense if, for example, the speaker was just recently made aware of [continent name]

* catastrophe, disaster, calamity were all used as name of a specific legendary past event
  * should now be exclusively referred to as the Calamity when referred to by name by humans

* northern sea/northern continent vs North Sea/North Continent
  * since the Empire is on "the continent", I'm going with the former, as in, the northern part of the only remaining continent in the world <del>and the sea north of said continent</del>
    * given than Ciencia Sea doesn't appear to encompass all of the water around the continent, maybe "North Sea" would be more appropiate

* gender issues 
  * Nimeas should now always be female
  * Cory should now always be male
  * the animals Mishy and Nora (the dog) are now referred to by those that know them using male and female pronouns, respectively, rather than being (almost) always genderless.

* transfer/transport(er) gate/device -> "transfer gate" should now exclusively refer to the large physical gates you walk through, and "teleporter device" for the small pads on the ground
* Training Book: stamp/seal -> seal

* Pyxia should no longer switch between making paintings and drawings
  * I guess it's okay if she makes sketches before starting a painting



## Terminology Changes ##

Some of the repeated terms I chose to change that I did not originally notice as inconsistent. Not that they weren't inconsistent, as some of them turned out to be after I changed them.

You might find these changes *somewhat* more meaningful/controversal than my shuffling words around detailed in the previous section. There's also lots more one-off stuff that has also been changed to mean something completely different, but probably not listed here, or else I'd just end up redescribing a sizable portion of the script. 

### miscellaneous terminology changes 

* familial terms
  * Because everyone addressing parents as "Father" and "Mother" as in the original is [weird](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalTitleCharacterization), (except for Ada, they did this no matter what parental title they actually used in Japanese), the default (read: my default) names kids use for their parents are now referred to as "Dad" or "Mom".
    * "tousan-tachi" in Japanese should now be translated as "Mom and Dad" (or "Mother and Father", or even just "parents"), rather than simply "Father" or "[Father and Mother](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/121756/mom-and-dad-vs-dad-and-mom)"
  * siblings should now usually use each other's names rather than referring to each other as "Brother" or "Sister" like they're in a monastery or in an [incest porn parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxnJcZvuRK8)
  * currently keeping most of Nayuta's use of Mr./Mrs. for most older adult villagers from original translation, rather than aunt/uncle
    * otherwise might confusingly imply one of them is their actual aunt/uncle
    * exception here is in Canie's case: In Japanese she insisted on Nayuta calling her older sister rather than aunt, his default for her and the rest of the adults. Meanwhile the original translation has Canie insist on Nayuta calling her Mrs. Canie rather than just Canie. I feel like a sister would normally be more familiar and younger than an aunt, and asking for a "Mrs." in front of her name implies the opposite of that.
    * keep "old man Barton" from original translation, he seems especially close to the Herschels, and was a good friend of William, so it's fine that it's only him
  * Ada no longer talks so much about Nayuta's sister (although Nayuta never reciprocates, she's calling herself nee-san, not randomly bringing up Eartha. currently changed to something like "your darling Ada")
  * remove the small kids (the polite ones, anyway) calling older kids (Nayuta, Cygna, Lyra) big brother/sister to be consistent with how the older kids address the young adults/even older kids (e.g. Ada, Dorado, Sasha)

* vigilance/vigilante committee/corps/force -> city guard
  * vigilance committee and vigilante corps are both used as translations for 自警団, but I personally have never heard of either
    * vigilance committees seem to have been an actual historical [thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilance_committee), meanwhile the top results for a google search for "vigilante corps" are about a law in Singapore and Counter Strike
    * that no one has any comments with Cygna casually dropping the idea he was part of some vigilante group *probably* means he wasn't acting outside the law like Batman (inb4 crime fighting Cygna prequel game)
    * decided on some variation of neighborhood/<del>town</del>/city/<del>island</del> guard/watch
      * not "town" or "island", since this was Cygna's actual job in the big city they lived in before the game started, but not back home on Remnant island 

* Nayuta is now referred to as being "a handyman", rather than literally being called "the Handyman Shop". The business he runs with Cygna is still called the Handyman Shop.

* fencing -> swordsmanship
  * Nayuta and Cygna fight with swords, but don't exactly seem to use fencing swords like laxia in Ys VIII

* Mythos -> Mitos 
  * rather than have a race named after a random English word, (oh so they're named Mythos because they're an ancient, mythical race? okay, that would be like Charlemagne declaring himself the king of the Medievals), use a random (not shared with English) Greek word instead. apparently means "warp thread", like the root for the word "mitosis". It also still means "myths" in Spanish and Portuguese.  
  Although by all likelihood what I'm doing to Greek (and Spanish) is what the the Japanese text did to English, at least the rest of the text isn't also Greek (or Spanish).
  * connection with mitosis could relate to their apparent ability to create, resurrect, and manipulate life. 
  * Possibly related that hajimari no kiseki [promo art](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kiseki/images/8/80/Key_Visual_(Hajimari).jpg) shows the grandmaster with similar white hair and holding some kind of yarn
    * even if they do ultimately turn out to be unrelated to the grandmaster, both could still be a reference to similar immortal beings who exert control over the destiny of the world and its life with [thread-related powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai). 
  * maybe sprinkle in some fun veiled sewing metaphors: "cut short", "thread of history/fate", "weave/twist", "seams"
    * adding more metaphors or such in general is probably a good idea
    * LMAO A FIBER OF INTENT
* god/God -> a god/the gods (cough, iwonderwhothiscouldreferto, cough)
* master -> lady/lord (for wardens addressing mitos)
  * their historical role and actions are remarkably similar to the Eldeen from Ys, and this is consistent with how Feena and Reah are addressed in Origin by their followers
* '"Cage"' -> 'prison' (the magical vase things that the Wardens are trapped in)
  * Wardens are "imprisoned", and their "prison" is sealed within a "barrier"
* spirit -> [nymph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph)
  * removes overlap between "spirit" referring to both the little sprite-like followers of the Wardens and the non-corporeal ghost-like forms characters take at some points
  * "nymph" fits with the whole "personifications of nature, typically tied to a specific place or landform"
* Remake/Remaking -> Recreate/Recreation, and not necessarily always capitalized
* Power of Stars -> astral power
  * see [here](https://kiseki.fandom.com/wiki/Mythus) (though I still have the same problem with "Mythus" as "Mythos", being also a word that exists in English) and [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/astral#English) (all three definitions could now relate somehow)
  * stuff like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_plane) seems to heavily inspire Falcom's cosmology
  * also considered: star/planetary/celestial/cosmic power/force/energy
    * from what we're shown, it really seems to have nothing to do with actual stars and is more of a universal life-granting power like [the Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force) It would make just as much sense to replace "Power of Stars" with "the Force" if this game were to somehow share a universe with Star Wars.
    * if it was "planetary" (alternate translation of word for star), it could be interpreted to mean it is derived from the planet itself, and could possibly explain why their race might want to fix the old planet instead of living on an artifical replacement like Terra
    * i'm still shaky on using "power" vs "energy"

* earth/Earth/surface (or surface world) -> surface, world, or planet
  * originally *almost* always translated as "surface", but it seems weird to always specifically refer the surface of a planet rather than just the whole planet itself (especially when you can eventually see for yourself that a lot more than just the surface of the planet has been affected by things, and most who actually knew it was a planet in the first place already knew this)
  * ground/earth/Earth seems to be an acceptable translation of the Japanese word used here, but in English the first two most often refer to the substance, while the latter refers specifically to *our* planet
    * Nayuta recognizes the meaning of the word "Terra" when he first hears it, so there's another thing to think about. apparently in Latin there's a similar ambiguity between the substance and the specific entity
  * humans definitely shouldn't call it anything but "world" until at least after moon reveal. except for William's theories, Lost Heaven almost seems to be commonly thought of as an alternate dimension or something and most think the world is flat (and therefore would definitely not be [considered a planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet))
    * let's just say the researchers, as smart dudes into astronomy, understand by the time they read zext's message. meanwhile maybe most others would probably find out by the epilogue, if they even bring it up at all

* cliff: chasm (when referring to the gap between two natural cliffs), wall (when referring to the sides of an artificial building)
* transfer gates "work" or "connect" when teleportation is available and "don't work" or "disconnect" when unavailable, rather than "moving" or "stopping" 
  * same goes for pretty much every other technology that previously "moved" or "stopped"
  * "run/execute programs" with astrolabe rather than "perform procedures"
* "Ancient Memories" -> Ancient Memory
  * singular, though I'm sure the mitos could make VR recreations of all kinds of things, this term is only ever used in reference to a specific recreation of a certain historical event. 
* "masked guy" -> "masked man" (except maybe for Cygna because he's casual like that)
* "method" -> "way" (as in, "there has to be another way", it's much more vague and uncertain)

* mineral/crystal/stone -> ore (i.e. the rocks used for making weapons/armor)

* Ada sidequest: "do a sake soak" -> make macerated fruit liqueur
* signature/famous products -> specialties (given that Nayuta has to ask around for them, they tend be not be all that famous, or even be actual products for sale)
* vel sidequest: poster -> note (they're supposed to hidden messages, not something posted for all to see)
* new menu -> new dish (as in, a single meal served in a restaurant, rather than a list of all meals to choose from)
* sculp makes sterotypical drunk noises, such as hiccuping and burping, rather than crying
* millionaire -> wealthy man/our client (pretty sure he was described as (one of?) the world's richest men, as well as spending a lot of mira in his life. "millionaire" is probably selling it short a little given how much mira you collect by the end of other kiseki games, or even this one)

* she's a good girl -> she's a good kid (sound less like the speaker is treating the subject as a dog)

* sick visit -> visit
  * "sick visit" doesn't mean anything in English by itself afaik, and Google search results use it to describe the "sick" themselves visiting a health care provider. I'm assuming there is a specific term for someone visiting a friend not in good health in Japanese that to my knowledge doesn't exist in English (You just "visit your friends at the hospital" or whatever, you don't "sick visit your friends")
* homestay -> stay over
  * similar to above, but for staying at someone else's house in an informal manner (i.e. I wouldn't exactly call having a friend sleep over to stay a night or two, which is what happens here, running a [homestay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestay) operation)

* Pyxia has this thing where she talks about being an egg/chicken. Since I also ran into the egg thing elsewhere, I'm guessing this is a normal Japanese metaphor for being a beginner/master at something. It's definitely not a normal English metaphor. Since Nayuta seems to think Pyxia is a little weird and has sweat drops whenever she mentions it, I'll let her keep her strange poultry metaphors.



### Name Changes


#### Items/Museum

* removed Japanese characters for some numbered items (book volumes 1, 2, etc.)
* item names longer than 20-21 characters should be shortened so they don't overlap with their quantity indicators.
  * Tyrant Drgn Fossil:Head -> Tyrannosaur Head
  * In general, "{Animal} Fossil:{Body Part}" -> "{Animal} {Body Part}" 
    and "{Animal} Taxidermy" -> "{Animal}" so that the longer names fit
    * Descriptions already indicate they're fossilized/stuffed
  * Jap. Rhinoceros Beetle -> Jap. Rhino Beetle
  * Portuguese Man o' War -> Man o' War
* pterodactyl -> [pteranodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteranodon)
  * someone originally decided to translate [プテラノドン](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%97%E3%83%86%E3%83%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%89%E3%83%B3) as [Pterodactyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodactylus) for some reason unknown to me. I thought maybe the skeleton looks more like a pterodactyl instead, but it doesn't, it has that huge crest
* It may be the case that they're *all* commonly called "kabuto" beetles in Japanese (not sure), but at least in English, [stag beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_beetle) are not considered a type of [rhinoceros beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynastinae). Descriptions should now correctly distinguish between them, rather than calling everything a rhinoceros beetle.
  * same goes with every prehistoric reptile being called a "dinosaur"
  * ammonites aren't snails
* Googled the scientific names to fix English names of museum animals, or add missing common names
  * lots of common names for various species of Asian grasshoppers and cicadas that I don't care to list
  * White Butterfly -> Cabbage White
  * Butterfly Dragonfly -> Flutterer
    * the exact species (fuliginosa) seems to have no English common name, but some others of the same genus are known as banded flutterers, sapphire flutterers, etc.
  * Frill Lizard -> Frilled Lizard
  * Serpent -> Cobra
  * koi's listed scientific name is unchanged, however (Cyprinus carpio) 
    * I think it was correct as of 2012, but it appears koi have since been reclassified under a different species (Cyprinus rubrofuscus)
* Bronze Sextant -> Bronze Instrument
  * it's described as modeling the heavenly bodies, which is exactly what an [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe) is.
* Dragon Egg -> Dinosaur Egg
* Moon bird egg: Egg of destruction beast -> Moon bird eggs: Eggs of an extinct animal
* Unopened Box (from Orvus sidequest) -> Locked Box
* Shard \<Name> -> Name Shard
  * Shard \<Light of Wisdom> -> Enlightenment Shard
* Zemuria Stone -> Zemurian Ore
* White/Crimson/Deep Crystal -> White/Crimson/Deep Ore

* Byakuda -> sandalwood
  * wiki walk: [ビャクダン](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%93%E3%83%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%80%E3%83%B3) -> Santalum album -> sandalwood
* Elumi -> [Elemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarium_luzonicum)

* Puriesta -> Sacerdos
  * I'm pretty sure this was originally just the literal English word "priest".  Now it's the literal word in Latin.
* Moon Rosso -> Luna Rossa
  * originally mix of english "Moon" and italian "Rosso". Now entirely italian

* Military Uniform/Armor -> Samurai Armor/Boots
* Fairy/Ether Cross -> Fairy/Ethereal Clothes
* "bronze" items are no longer described as made of "copper"


#### Locations

* St. Cerize -> <del>St. Cerise</del> <del>San Ceres?</del> <del> San Ceriz </del> Saint Cerise
  * google translate romanizes it (サンセリーゼ) as something like "sanserize", which is different than say, the romanized name for St. Louis (セントルイス - Sentoruisu) and more like that of San Salvador (サンサルバドル - Sansarubadoru), so I think "San" is better here. It also fits together with the Spanish "Ciencia"
  * at this point I'm unsure if the second part is referencing cherries, the roman harvest goddess/dwarf planet, or both, so I'll try to not be too on the nose and use "Ceriz", which is neither, but I imagine would be pronounced similarly to the Spanish "feliz", and somewhat similarly how most English speakers would pronounce both Cerise and Ceres.
  * so I did some searches and found that "Saint Arkh" starts with "sento" in Japanese, as expected, but "Saint-Gral" and "Saint-Croix" start with "san", like here.
    * The only instance of "San" I could find in English is the store named "San Corries" in Cold Steel, which also starts with "san" in Japanese. But then they use the English word "corries", which comes from Gaelic, and not Spanish like "Correas" or something 
    * I'll be consistent with the names of other major locations and render it as "Saint"
    * and since we're anglicizing stuff, might as well go back to "Cerise", the only explicitly English word out of the above. 

* Moon View Pavillion -> Moonlight Pavilion
  * I can't figure out what the Japanese means beyond "moon", but "Moonlight" sounds better than "Moon View"? at least, "moon" and "light" are used often enough together in English to have its own word. Also "pavillion" is supposedly an obsolete spelling
    * maybe "Luna Vista" to keep the Spanish thing going?
* Herschel House -> Herschels' House

* "Giant Dragon Graveyard" -> "Dragon Graveyard"
  * original name is too long to be displayed on world map screen

* Muncipial District -> Urban District (no mention at all of any government, just a city part of Terra that humans were intended to live in. "Residential District" might be even better?)
* Cradle Area -> Birthing Chamber (formerly used for raising animals, also pretty creepy looking)
  * not written the same way as the the Cradle District in SC, or used for the same purpose (not a human residential district)
* Glowing Dust Area -> Shining Shard Area (consistency with shining stones/star shards)



#### Characters


* Michey -> Mishy (match official localizations)
* Kureha -> Creha
  * Previous translators picked her brother's name to look more Arabic. I personally know less about Arabic that I do about Japanese, but at least "Creha" looks less Japanese. Not that they're always the best (see: [Dalk Fukt](https://www.falcom.co.jp/ys12_psp/character.html)), but "Creha" also seems to be the [official romanization](https://falcom-collections.net/Nayuta%20No%20Kiseki/nayuta04s.jpg.html) of her name
    * on her brother's name, it could be that any variation of vowels between ["SLM"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0-L-M) would work. (rather than the official romanization "Serum" or his internal name "Seram")
  * the downside here is that her name appears in voiced scenes pretty frequently, where you can hear it starting with an audible "ku" sound
* Dr. Volans -> Professor Volans

3/4 of the wardens now (alongside Algol) directly refer to astronomical objects (they all do if you consider Nemeas to reference the Nemean Lion, which is associated with the constellation Leo)
* Gio -> [Geo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo)
* Eliselette/Elislette -> [Eris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet))ette

For character names based off of constellations, change spellings to more closely resemble (but not necessarily match) Latin spelling
* Aquela -> Aquila
* Axe -> Ax (from Fornax)
* Bootie -> Boote (from Bootes)
  * needs to look less like booty. it seems to often be spelled "Boötes" in English, but unfortunately inserting accented characters doesn't work, so unfamiliar English speakers might be likely to pronounce this version as "boot" or "boat". I remember mentally pronouncing "Bootes" as "Boot-es" myself when I first played SMT: Strange Journey. Still better than "booty" though. 
* Collie -> Cory (from one of Corona Australis/Borealis, along with Coron)
* Equlea -> Equulea (from Equuleus)
* Hydol -> Hydrol (from Hydra/Hydrus)
* Pencula -> Pecula (from Vulpecula)
* <del>Serpent -> Serpen (from Serpens)</del>
  * <del>keeping for the same reason I'm replacing "Saint" with "San", </del>there's a definite "to" sound present at the end of his name in Japanese
* <del>Victor -> Pictor</del>
  * keeping it, since at least Victor is an actual name. same goes for Janis (from Canis)


#### Monsters 

The bosses you fight throughout the story are supposed to be related somehow to the zodiac constellations:

* Duoqurois -> Duokuroi (from Gemini, or [Dioskuroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux) + Duo)
* Palreschia -> Pallichthya (Pisces, or ikthyos or ichthyos in Greek + maybe Pallas?)
* Sagiscellan -> Sagicheiron (Sagittarius + Hecatoncheir?)

* Livadrigger -> Libradigger (Libra)

* Raigivern -> Raprivern (Capricorn + wyvern)
* Ishtaros -> Ishtauros (Taurus + maybe Ishtar)
* Gradleon -> Gladarieon (supposed to be Aries, not Leo. Also "Glad" from the Latin "gladius" because the boss is associated with swords)
* Armadaries -> Armadilleos (supposed to be Leo, not Aries. also an armadillo)
* Stell Alaqran -> Stell Arcorion (Scorpio + Stella)


More monster changes:

* Gurupus -> Garupus (a bird, so I thought of Garuda. I might be wrong in this case)
* Incense -> Innocence (a being made *purely* from this whole source of all life stuff)
* Encent Mage -> Ancient Mage
* Bullmajiro -> Bullmadillo (a charging armadillo)
* Bullgatorio -> Purgatorio (I don't know where the bull comes from here, it's just a dragon)
* Rideleon -> Riderion (a humanoid robot that transforms into a bike, hence "rider". has no lion form)
* Warcat -> Werecat
* Beowulf -> Werewolf
* Zoropino -> Zorropino (Spanish for fox + pine)

* Flame Spirit -> Flamme Geist (the Japanese is literally "fureimugaisuto")
* Soldart -> Soldat (soldier, nothing about darting)
* Shuvalgrif -> Chevalgriff (it's a just hippogriff, but I guess they opted to use the French word for "horse" instead of the Greek one)
* Demon Zerob -> Demon's Robe (it's a robe brought to life)

* Suikesu Keeper/Sukeisu Keeper -> Scissor Keeper (a version of the Root Keeper than uses "leaf blade magic")
* Ice Velg -> Tempano (pretty sure it was just the English word "Iceberg". Now it's Spanish)
* Evil Tycoon -> Evil <del>[Typhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon) (a version of the Evil Dragon, which is, of course, a dragon, not a capitalist)</del>
  * the red Ragnard copy in Sky 3rd is called "R-Tycoon" but that also makes no sense, at least in the English usage of the word "tycoon" (which turns out is actually a loanword from Japanese, with an original meaning that does actually make some sense)
  * switching to "Taikun", more modern romanization of the Japanese word
* Expert Lion/Expatrion -> Expeltron (another robot that was translated into a lion)
* Gerou Aspis -> Guerra Aspis ("aspis" is a Latin word, so use another one)
* Vulganon -> Vulkanon (supposed to be evocative of volcanos, not zelda)
* Dizodyne -> Discordyne (discord + dyne)
* Solar Sofia -> Solar Sphere (literally a ball of sunlight, no mention of it being wise)
* Flower Batolei -> Flower Betrayer (described as a parasite to other monsters)

* <del>Albion -> Hyperion (a giant, not the island of Britain.</del>
  * Nope, [Albion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion_(Blake)) is right. Although I can't find any references to Albion/Alebion being a giant (rather than just a nondescript son of Poseidon) outside of Blake's stuff
* Lindblum -> [Lindworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindworm) (a white dragon)



### tentative/unsure/wanted to change at some point

* implement spicier wording
  * use more technobabblesque phrasing from people familiar with Terra
    * revived/resurrected idols -> regenerated?
    * errors, glitches, etc
    * warden: rename to admin(instrator)? (maybe better fit Terra/Astrolabe being giant futuristic computer-like thing with computery term)
  * geo: how does one even speak like an old man
  * algol: ye elizabethan english?
  * noi is supposed to have some verbal tic with the way she ends sentences too
* remove multiple exclamation points (!!) except in cases of extreme exclamation

* head (Zext, as in "head of the mythos") -> chief, leader, director?

* sometimes people talk about "this sea". not sure if this is an expression roughly equivalent to "the whole world", like "sailing the seven seas" (and should instead be something like "these seas" or 
"this world"), the events weren't as far-reaching as they were previously mentioned to be, or if it literally implies the Cienca Sea is the only sea in the world
  * 0115 0xb313
  * <del>I'm assuming the latter is true</del>, "the continent" is implied to be the sole remaining continent in the world
    * however, when Antlia is talking about a flower that grows on the western continent, he says something like "it doesn't grow in the Ciencia Sea". and since the northern part of the continent gets cold, while Renmant Island is always warm, it can be assumed that Remnant Island (and at least part of the Ciencia Sea with it) is south of the continent, and what is considered the Ciencia Sea doesn't extend to the west.
    * Cetus separately lists the Ciencia sea, eastern island(s), and the northern continent as places he's explored
    * Remnant Island is suggested to be part of some archipelago, with various dialogue talking about other islands
      * Ciencia Sea could possibly just refer to the region around the archipelago, like the Carribean or the Sea of Japan
      * it's also unclear whether Saint Cerise is a city on the continent (like Miami) or just on a bigger, more populated island (like Nassau)



* "fairy from fairy tale"
  * its sounds less repetitive and inane when people relate a fairy (yosei) creature to something out of a fairy tale (otogibanashi) when the literal word "fairy" isn't in the name
  * however, I think "fairy tale" is better at emphasizing the fantastic (woah, a fairy) and ubiquitious (everyone immediately recognizes Noi to be a fairy) elements of fairy tales. "Myths" or "legends" are not necessarily believed to be untrue, and also not necessarily told to everyone as children and widely known. "fables" are more about the morals than the fantastic, believed untrue elements people are trying to reference 
    * maybe I should just be vague and say "stories"?

* Ida (the cat) -> Eda (from Andromeda)

* why does mira == shining stones?
  * maybe shining stones is the correct name for the star shards, which can be sold for mira?

* "--" instead of "─"?

* refer to nymphs as female rather than keep them awkwardly genderless?

* rephrase "abnormalities", at least sometimes so it doesn't seem as if the whole world has somehow instantly come to a consensus on what to call literally everything that happens
  * anomolies, aberrations, irregularities
  * error/malfunction when in context of astrolabe going wrong, or at least use different term than the weather
  * abnormal (weather) conditions, anomolous
  * events, incidents, etc also appear to be viable translations

* the fuck is a "Sprout Magatama"
  * doesn't appear during the corresponding quest it's listed under, and the phrase "芽吹きの勾玉" only appears in these same two files in the original Japanese. Unused dummy text?

* (N.S.) - I previously removed this because I wanted to avoid [real world references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates), same as how the original translation would sometimes call the surface "Earth." However, this one might also serve as a hint that there are at least [two calendar systems](#zemuria-references) currently in use.

* Rieseweld - Riese[woerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terp) or some other variation (instead of something deriving from Wald, meaning "forest" when that continent has no forests)
  * apparently there are [some](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wold#English) [derivations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weald#English) of "wald" that can also denote an *un*forested place

## technical notes

### Why not just use flame's tools directly?

Before I started, I extracted everything from an iso of the original fantranslation. The addresses of each line in the English script then did not match up with the addresses of each line of the Japanese script, breaking the script insertion, well, script. My changes to the tools were mainly just so that the addresses from the dumped Japanese files are used instead of the addresses of each line of the input files.

However, once I started testing the output, it seemed the released tools only *mostly* work as is. Even if I were to revert all of my changes and try to use them as <del>God</del> flame intended, I ran into a number of issues not present in the 4.15 fantranslation release:
  1. item/money received messages in cutscenes are broken (those with opcode `0xC1`)
  2. Some text remains in their original Japanese forms, with no Enlish displayed: Nayuta and Noi's names (stored in `text/pc.tsv`), tutorial menus (from `text/helplib.tsv`), food ingredient locations (`text/foodarea.tsv`) and some dialogue (namely, those in `script/noi.tsv` and `script/system.tsv`).
  3. chapter start/end graphics are still in Japanese
  4. The text about your next objective that appears when pressing select is not updated
  5. can't talk to Mishy in first few chapters: an exclamation point appears when approaching, but nothing happens when you try to interact. He remained perfectly in in Chapter 2 and after starting Chapter 5.
  6. I would occasionally encounter some stray lines of Japanese text underneath my English text in long text boxes (`0x41` op codes)

Clearly, there were undocumented shenanigans that went on in the original fantranslation, given that none of these issues exist in its final release.


#### "Solutions"

Here's how I solved or managed to work around each of the above problems. In about half of the cases where the programs themselves were actually bugged, I only managed to fix one. The rest were resolved more with workarounds, involving the use of bug-free files from the 4.15 release and/or a hex editor.

If you want to do a actual, proper retranslation of this game yourself and you're like me and not smart enough to write your own tools or fix the existing ones, you might have to do something similar.

  1. the broken item messages do not occur if I simply do not run the provided script inserter, but obviously, that leaves me unable to insert any of my script changes. This seemed to indicate something was wrong the script inserter.
      * Switching to [Flame's earlier Python 2 script inserter](https://pastebin.com/vtVwq338) released in 2015 seemed to fix this, but it had its own problems. But looking through it, I noticed there was a special case that applied only to these particular problematic textboxes 
      * changing a 1 to a 3 in for the `0xC1` entry in the dictionary defined in the beginning of the Python 3 inserter fixed #1 without introducing any other problems. The inserter in this repo should include this change.
  2. Only Japanese text in places (no English): copying `PSP_GAME/USRDIR/pack` folder from the 4.15 translation solved the Japanese appearing for the `noi` and `system` files. To me, this seemed to indicate something is wrong with the `copy_*.py` files. Along with copying your new files to the extracted ISO, they also are intended to modify the files in the `pack` folder so that your new files are read instead of a compressed Japanese version. This doesn't seem to actually be done for those files. At least, this isn't done successfully.
      * However, any changes made in `pc`, `foodarea` and `helplib` are still not reflected. I'm not entirely sure how to fix this. Currently I'm stuck using the versions of these files originating from flame's fantranslation. `foodarea.bin` and `pc.bin` seem to be easily modifiable with a hex editor. 
  3. Chapter titles: like with #2, I copied the files from the 4.15 ISO, in this case from `PSP_GAME/USRDIR/visual/event`. While other translated graphics are included with flame's tools, but for some reason the chapter start/end graphics aren't.
  4. the correct objective text will be used if the story is continued to the next objective. It appears this is not at all the fault of the tools, and the text for the current objective is loaded directly from your savefile.
  5. The Mishy issue was also not entirely the fault of the tools. For some reason, Mishy's internal name ("Michy") was exposed in `chr_names.tsv` as well as his name that is displayed above his textboxes (originally "Michey"). For comparison, Mensa was called "Mrs. Mensa" in the original translation, and has an internal name of "Mensa", but only appeared once in `chr_names.tsv` (as "Mrs. Mensa"). I've also been able to break shopkeepers by changing the wrong names in `chr_names.tsv`, so just make sure you only change the right one? 
  6. Extra Japanese text (underneath my English): I would usually be able to fix these by reformatting my English text to use an extra line in the text box. However, I encountered this again for two lines when reading the message at the end of Volans' sidequest, but wasn't able to fix it this way. I found that opening mp_0115.bin in a hex editor and changing the first byte of the phantom line to 00 worked. (after what *should* to be last line, there'll be some non-zero bytes, then zeros, then some non-zero bytes. Zero out the first of the non-zero bytes after the zeros. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/aospeqr.png): Zero out the highlighted byte)


### other stuff
  * accented characters, like for Soufflé or Boötie don't work
  * emdashes (—) don't display well, light horizontal (─) hyphen is better
  * same goes whatever the tilde character on my keyboard is (~), use ～ instead
  * some other non ascii characters: ─ □×△ ☆～♪ ※ ①②③ 『』 ㈱ (appears as heart in game)
  * search for all non ascii characters with `[^\x00-\x7F]`
  * creating a patch requires large buffer size, or resulting patch file will be huge
```
xdelta3 -9 -S djw -B 1812725760 -evfs "nayuta.iso" "output.iso" "patch.xdelta"
```
1812725760 is the max size in bytes of a psp umd, so it could probably made smaller

some nonsensical, but spoilerly one-liners I didn't want to screenshot:
* moons 
  * One of the twin moons started	
    to break apart, and this	
    creepy-looking thing emerged.
  * The two moons became one, and eerily,
    they've started to wane.

* doctor prognosis: she has a month to live vs he personally spent a month searching for yupina grass 

* Sasha
  * Milady was trained	
  since she was young to assume the role	
  of the next head of the family.  	
  * vs "received special education for gifted children"

#### ys
in my mind the whole game is thematically a retelling of ys i and ii, with some of ys iv/vi giant climate control machine+clan of darkness backstory and a happier ending
  * nayuta - adol (protagonist, likely leaves home to become adventurer at 16-17 years old)
  * cygna - dogi (Heterosexual Life-Partners with protagonist)
  * creha - feena (amnesiac damsel in distress that the protagonist seems to have a thing for, leaving almost no time of day for the numerous other girls who also seem into the protagonist, also happens to be a god with long, strangely colored hair)
  * selam - reah (god-sibling of the above)
  * lyra - lilia (most notable example of one of the other girls also into the protagonist. He saves her life one time, but the protagonist appears to give zero shits about her crush. short brown hair)
  * orvus - goban (late game plot device opening door to final dungeon, father figure of sorts to Heterosexual Life-Partner)
  * eartha - sara (early game plot device pointing you towards macguffin)
  * zext - dark fact/dalles (sinister evil magic dude in robes)
  * noi - darm (source/embodiment of the magic you use, final boss)

  * mitos - eldeen (race of "gods" with magical powers, previously worshipped by humans, and had advanced technology, such as giant climate control device and city in the sky)
  * aquela - clan of darkness, esp. those from Danan (repentant descendants of humans who betrayed race of gods)
  * power of stars - emelas (power usable by said "gods")
  * idols - galba (giant artificial monsters guarding something important)
  * humans destroy environment with wars, accelerate collapsing core of planet - humans destroy environment with mine, unearth cleria and bring back demons

---

#### zemuria references
  * zemurian ore
  * mishy, poms
  * geography 
    * a single continent with Empire that always seems to be at the brink of war with neighbors, but with a purportedly reasonable prince
    * forests in western parts of continent, cold in northern parts
    * *something* that stops people from sailing too far out at sea
    * mishy theme park on continent
  * same measurement units (selge, arge, etc.) and money (mira)
    * current year is 1579 as opposed to early 1200s, so either far in the future (Loewe: "mankind will repeat its mistakes forever") or using a different calendar (no mention of Aidios, though Nayuta brings up the lack of a church on Remnant Island to the doctor so churches must exist elsewhere)
      * use of N.S. means there must be at least 1 other "Old Style" calendar system in place
  
assuming the continent *is* the zemuria that we know (and not some parallel version of it), the conditions at the end of this game (only one moon, but fully accessible planet) could only mean:

- this game is in the distant past of other games (before Great Collapse)  
  - humanity eventually returns to its old problems and cause another disaster, the Great Collapse, and maybe a third one looms again in the S.1200s

- this game is in the near past of other games (after Great Collapse)  
  - needs to be distant enough that worldwide abnormal weather, rocks falling from the sky, and disappearance of the second moon become overshadowed by other events, like the Orbal Revolution or multiple wars, and for star shards from Terra to become extremely rare
  - not much of the new area is made known before humanity falls back to its old problems and End of the World returns or something to prevent people from exploring the rest of the world, threatening another cataclysmic disaster unknown to humans

- if this game was in the distant future of other games (i.e. other games are before the Great Flood), more than one continent should exist and be accessible
- if this game was in the near future of other games (i.e. other games are after the Great Flood), there should be [two moons visible in the sky](https://i.imgur.com/b2SXfaI.jpg)

And of course, they could always be in some alternate dimension like the Aureole was or something.
